In our research, the model building process is viewed as a learning activity and inductive machine learning techniques from AI are combined with traditional optimization methods to form our prototype model building system called AIMS (Adaptive and Interactive Modeling System). The layered analysis models built by AIMS offer several distinctive advantages over those traditional analysis models which can only provide evaluations at very detailed stages of decision making. These advantages include: early evaluation to avoid costly iterations, fast execution for interactive applications, more comprehensibility for human inspection, and deep roots in domain physics for higher accuracy.

In this paper, optimal route criteria for THM are selected using a new approach in the field of multi-criteria decision-making.

Therefore, it is important for organizations to adopt a systematic way to evaluate and select the best supplier according to their respective criteria in today's competitive environment. Multicriteria decision-making methods provide for this need of organizations because determination of an appropriate supplier selection is a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem essentially. Although a lot of applications of these methods for supplier evaluation and selection can be seen in the literature, studies in the health-care sector are insufficient. Hospitals in the health-care sector also have to consider their supplier-related decisions to decrease risks and threads which affect their effectiveness. The aim of this study was to fill this gap by providing different hybrid models for selecting the best supplier for hospitals. Supplier evaluation and selection process start with recognizing the related criteria according to the studies in the literature. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is deployed to weight the criteria, and suppliers are listed via technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), elimination and choice translating reality English (ELECTRE), grey relational analysis (GRA), and simple additive weighting (SAW) methods. The main aim of this study was to present different hybrid MCDM methods and show their efficiency and consistency with each other. In this study, hybrid multicriteria decision-making models (AHP-TOPSIS, AHP-ELECTRE, AHP-GRA, and AHP-SAW) are presented and compared.

The concept of 'intertemporal choice' describes choices between outcomes at different times in the future. Short-sighted decisions with far-reaching effects are a long-standing cause of concern in the software profession. Common models to support decisions in software projects use concepts such as expected utility and discount factors to quantify future value and enable trade-off decisions. However, a growing body of behavioral research shows that these normative models do not adequately describe how people actually make choices. Our objective is to understand how developers and stakeholders actually take trade-off decisions during software projects that involve current and future benefits, and to identify the human and cooperative factors that influence them. This requires empirical research on decision making in SE with a focus on trade-offs across time. To support such research, this paper reports on a systematic literature review that aimed to identify whether the intersection of these concepts has been acknowledged and addressed. We discuss the assumptions about decision makers that underpin existing research and analyze how the role of time has been characterized in the study of decision making in SE.

In our research, the model building process is viewed as a learning activity and inductive machine learning techniques from AI are combined with traditional optimization methods to form our prototype model building system called AIMS (Adaptive and Interactive Modeling System). The layered analysis models built by AIMS offer several distinctive advantages over those traditional analysis models which can only provide evaluations at very detailed stages of decision making. These advantages include: early evaluation to avoid costly iterations, fast execution for interactive applications, more comprehensibility for human inspection, and deep roots in domain physics for higher accuracy.

In this paper, optimal route criteria for THM are selected using a new approach in the field of multi-criteria decision-making. Weight coefficients of these criteria were determined by applying the Full Consistency Method (FUCOM).

Therefore, it is important for organizations to adopt a systematic way to evaluate and select the best supplier according to their respective criteria in today's competitive environment. Multicriteria decision-making methods provide for this need of organizations because determination of an appropriate supplier selection is a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem essentially. Although a lot of applications of these methods for supplier evaluation and selection can be seen in the literature, studies in the health-care sector are insufficient. Hospitals in the health-care sector also have to consider their supplier-related decisions to decrease risks and threads which affect their effectiveness. The aim of this study was to fill this gap by providing different hybrid models for selecting the best supplier for hospitals. Supplier evaluation and selection process start with recognizing the related criteria according to the studies in the literature. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is deployed to weight the criteria, and suppliers are listed via technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), elimination and choice translating reality English (ELECTRE), grey relational analysis (GRA), and simple additive weighting (SAW) methods. The main aim of this study was to present different hybrid MCDM methods and show their efficiency and consistency with each other. In this study, hybrid multicriteria decision-making models (AHP-TOPSIS, AHP-ELECTRE, AHP-GRA, and AHP-SAW) are presented and compared. The results show that the presented hybrid methods in this study are consistent with each other and give the same ranking for the selection of the best supplier.

The concept of 'intertemporal choice' describes choices between outcomes at different times in the future. Short-sighted decisions with far-reaching effects are a long-standing cause of concern in the software profession. Common models to support decisions in software projects use concepts such as expected utility and discount factors to quantify future value and enable trade-off decisions. However, a growing body of behavioral research shows that these normative models do not adequately describe how people actually make choices. Our objective is to understand how developers and stakeholders actually take trade-off decisions during software projects that involve current and future benefits, and to identify the human and cooperative factors that influence them. This requires empirical research on decision making in SE with a focus on trade-offs across time. To support such research, this paper reports on a systematic literature review that aimed to identify whether the intersection of these concepts has been acknowledged and addressed. We discuss the assumptions about decision makers that underpin existing research and analyze how the role of time has been characterized in the study of decision making in SE.

Contrary to data-driven methods, PINNs have been shown to be able to approximate and generalize well a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs) by imbedding the underlying physical laws describing the PDE. PINNs, however, can struggle with the modeling of hyperbolic conservation laws that develop shocks, and a classic example of this is the Buckley\u2013Leverett problem for fluid flow in porous media. In this work, we explore specialized neural network architectures for modeling the Buckley\u2013Leverett shock front. We present extensions of the standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) that are inspired by the attention mechanism. The attention-based model was, compared to the multilayer perceptron model, and the results show that the attention-based architecture is more robust in solving the hyperbolic Buckley\u2013Leverett problem, more data-efficient, and more accurate. Moreover, by utilizing distance functions, we can obtain truly data-free solutions to the Buckley\u2013Leverett problem.

For example, in Malaysia, a number of efforts have been pursued to develop strong computational thinking among school students through the implementation of learning activities that nurture such a skill in most of the school subjects. However, previous studies have shown that teachers have a low understanding and misconception about the concept of computational thinking, which could derail such efforts. Furthermore, the lack of studies focusing on motivating students to actively participate in the learning process is further compounding such a predicament. Premised on this context, this study was carried out to examine the impact of cooperative learning on the development of CT skill among a group of 25 Year-3 students, aged 9, which was carried out based on three learning approaches, namely student-centric, hands-on, and inquiry-based approaches. Through such learning, which took place at one private school located in Selangor, Malaysia, the students learned four learning concepts related to a topic of a science subject. In this study, the researcher played the role of a teacher by teaching these students the learning concepts using a lesson plan designed based on the three learning approaches. The methodology used to collect data was based on a class observation and an interview with the science teacher. The analysis of the qualitative data revealed that students were highly engaged and participative in the learning process and were able to learn the scientific concepts of the subject matter with greater efficacy, which was indicative of their improved CT skill.

Intrinsic difficulties of the first approach: semantic gap between resources and the problem, instability of global schema w.r.t. a set of resources, inability of automatic identification of resources for the problem.

This paper proposes to overcome this challenge by triggering handovers only when needed and, once triggered, to find an optimal sequence to reach a target system condition with minimal handovers. This paper designs a greedy per-user control algorithm that has a fine control granularity and thus enables convergence to an optimal solution. The in-depth evaluation of the paper shows that HO-FIM improves the service quality of both macro- and femtocell users; in an example simulation scenario, HO-FIM is shown to improve the signal-to-interference and noise ratios (SINRs) of macro- and femtocell users by up to 23.3 and 2.9 dB, respectively, on average, compared to the case of no handovers.", "authors": [{"authorId": "39834900", "name": "Ji-Hoon Yun"}]}, {"paperId": "29ec2bd4076b8dd93c92b2a540d39207c4a55aa1", "title": "Price-driven coordination for solving plant-wide MPC problems", "abstract": "Abstract Two-level model predictive control (MPC) is the dominant multi-variable control technology in the process industries.

The price-driven coordination scheme requires the existence of \u201cequilibrium prices\u201d and has extensive large-scale applications in economic planning. On-line solutions to large-scale optimization problems require an efficient price-adjustment method. As the coordination problem for decentralized MPC falls into the category of limited resource case, this work develops an efficient price-adjustment algorithm by using Newton's method, in which sensitivity analysis and active set change identification techniques are employed. The proposed price-adjustment strategy is incorporated into a coordinated, decentralized MPC scheme that shows a high degree of accuracy, while retaining the reliability of original decentralized scheme at a reasonable computational load.", "authors": [{"authorId": "2073538028", "name": "Ruoyu Cheng"}, {"authorId": "31225043", "name": "Fraser Forbes"}, {"authorId": "145144977", "name": "W.

Accordingly, in this study, we criticize the lack of conceptual engineering to integrate ethical principles and values into the design and application of data-driven endeavours, with a particular examination at health data. We argue how we cannot strive for a robust ethical assessment without a critically causal frameworkMethodsFirstly, we analyse the translational gap and conceptual conflation of the terms: \u2018bias and fairness\u2019 and \u2018transparency and explainability\u2019, highlighting the misleading definitions and uses given to these concepts at a technical and ethical level. The main distinctions presented clarify the moral expectations given to these concepts and criticise the insufficient development of a conceptual analysis that targets them. We suggest that a fundamental part of a solution to reduce this translational gap implies embracing and applying a causal framework. Thus, we show why using causal models and, most importantly, a causal narrative cannot only help to prevent unethical effects, but it can also influence the efficiency of prediction models and their outcomes. Efficiency, in this case, transforms into an ethically laden concept that demands a causal narrative to align with ethical principles. Finally, we go through examples of COVID-19 decision-making that could have benefitted from a causal approach, highlighting the negative consequences of the NHS electronic health records platform and an OpenSAFELY publication in Nature that substantially suffers from the Table 2 Fallacy.DiscussionThis analysis puts into discussion an interdisciplinary approach to increase critical ethical awareness about fairness. Providing robust and reliable frameworks to analyse and present data, especially in sensitive times like a world pandemic, requires trustworthy practices.ConclusionIntegrating ethics into data-driven solutions cannot be limited by the bias-aware fairness formalisations or the naive applications of transparency and explainability. When it comes to the real-world application of models, their effects can harm individuals in society. Non-causal approaches tend to dissipate elements of agency and responsibility, which are fundamental to the development of what we can call \u2018good science\u2019.", "authors": [{"authorId": "119510466", "name": "G.

Students scored slightly lower on the cognitive dimensions of inquiry rich/multiple paths and markedly lower on transdisciplinary approaches when collaborating. Findings suggest to increase CPS skills, teachers might develop \u201cmaking\u201d activities fostering greater inquiry and model ways to strategize and verify information, approach the problem drawing on student interest and prior knowledge and collaboratively use tools, materials and methods that mimic the real world when problem-solving.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nMuch of the current research on assessing CPS during making is in the early stages of considering appropriate assessment approaches, especially in schools.

The Industry Hothousing variant of CPS in its adult format is an intensive, time-constrained workshop based process designed to build mutual trust between customers and industry experts in order to synergically develop creative solutions together. Its potential use in schools raises two important questions: Firstly, what degree of structure and support is required to unleash student creativity and enhance learning - as in industry or does the student need more structured methods including explicitly being taught collaborative problem solving skills? Secondly, is CPS an enrichment activity taking up additional teacher time or is it potentially cross-curricular and thus of wider benefit to teachers and students? The Hothousing CPS process for students is based on an intensive series of workshops based on trust including face-to-face and on-line collaboration supported by a facilitator. It is student-driven and addresses an open-ended challenge such as \u201c \"How do I get my friends to LOVE STEAM?\" or \u201cDesign the optimal solution to the city\u2019s traffic problem.\u201d or \"How do I raise my friends\u2019 interest toward learning?\".

Engineering design thinking is \" a complex cognitive process \" often complex, involving multiple levels of interacting components within a system that may be nested within or connected to other systems. Systems thinking is an essential facet of engineering design cognition (Accreditation Although systems thinking has not previously played a prominent role in engineering education research, it is becoming recognized as an important engineering trait (Dym & Little, 2009; Katehi et al., 2009). Due to the nascency of systems thinking research in engineering education, there are few studies that have investigated systems thinking and its impact on engineering design, particularly with K\u201312 students. As a result, how high school students employ systems thinking processes and strategies is not adequately understood or identified. This research examined high school students' systems cognitive issues, processes, and themes while they engaged in a collaborative engineering design challenge. Cognitive issues are mental activities used during a design challenge, while the processes are the ways in which the issues are approached or sequenced (Gero, 1990). Using exploratory triangulation mixed method research, the systems cognitive issues and processes were analyzed through the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) cognitive analysis framework. Additionally, emerging systems thinking themes and phenomena in engineering design were analyzed thematically outside of the FBS framework. Data from the different sources (verbal, video, computer movements, and sketches) were coded, organized, categorized, and synthesized for themes and patterns. Each data analysis technique yielded useful results on their own, but they were also used together to produce a broader understanding of systems thinking. The research was guided by two questions:1. What are the cognitive issues and processes used by high school students when attempting an engineering design challenge analyzed through the FBS framework? 2. Are there emerging qualitative themes and phenomena as they relate to systems thinking in engineering design? If there are themes or phenomena, how can these themes and phenomena be analyzed and interpreted\u2014essentially repeatedly reviewing and analyzing the data sources outside of the FBS framework looking for themes, patterns, and phenomena? Background Engineering design is a process that has no agreed upon definition. Nevertheless, there are multiple K\u201312 programs and curricula that purport to teach engineering design (Katehi et al., 2009).

The results highlight that higher perceived design thinking ability increases senior engineering students\u2019 interests in designing solutions related to energy sustainability. Active learning experiences positively influence senior engineering students\u2019 interests in designing solutions related to energy sustainability. These findings show the importance of teaching design thinking in engineering courses to empower future engineers to address sustainable challenges through design and innovation.", "authors": [{"authorId": "71744438", "name": "J.

Engineering employs principles of mathematics and science to create technologies, thus serving as a STEM integrator. Design is recognized as the critical element of engineering thinking which differentiates engineering from other problem solving approaches. The purpose of this exploratory research was to clarify engineering design as a construct and perform empirical preparatory research on engineering design as a STEM learning experience for high school students. Engineering design has the potential to integrate science, technology and mathematics concepts for students and is essential for developing technological literacy . This three year project tested the reasonableness of comparing high school student engineering design thinking with that of experts, and investigates the feasibility of these research methods by addressing the following question: How does high school student engineering design thinking compare to that of experts in terms of engineering design performance and knowledge? Fifty-nine participants from four states were asked to think out loud in a three hour design challenge which was video and audio recorded. Verbal protocol analysis was conducted as the students engaged in the engineering design process. The area of focus for this paper is time allocations across essential elements of the design process. This research may help to uncover the elusive cognitive thought processes employed by students as they practice engineering design thinking and will inform curriculum developers and teachers planning classroom strategies to improve high school students\u2019 understanding of engineering.", "authors": [{"authorId": "144536629", "name": "K.
