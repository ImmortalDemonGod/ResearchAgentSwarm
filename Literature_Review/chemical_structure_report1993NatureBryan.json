charge-transfer salts based on neutral \\(\\pi\\)-radicals\n\nC D Bryan\\({}^{\\star}\\), A W Cordes\\({}^{\\star}\\), R M Fleming\\({}^{\\dagger}\\), N A George\\({}^{\\ddagger}\\), S H

Waszczak\\({}^{\\dagger}\\)\n\nMost molecular conductors rely on charge transfer to create carriers For example, the ET salts' are hole-doped whereas the \\(C_{\\alpha}\\) salts\\({}^{\\rm 2}\\) are electron-doped Neutral radical species in which bands are formed by \\(\\pi\\)-orbital overlap would be expected to have half-filled bands and thus to be conducting\\({}^{\\star}\\), but no such metals have yet been reported Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a molecular conductor which combines both of these approaches: energy bands are formed from one-dimensional stacks of neutral \\(\\pi\\)-radicals, and the material is rendered conducting by electron transfer from the conduction band following doping with an acceptor The radical species is the 1,4-charge-bis(dithiadiazole)) diradical 1,4-([S\\({}_{3}\\)N\\({}_{2}\\)C)\\({}_{4}\\)H\\({}_{4}\\)(CN\\({}_{3}\\)S\\({}_{2}\\)] (2 in Fig 1), reaction of which widline vapour leads to crystals of [2][] At low temperatures this compound is essentially a diamagnetic insulator, but above 200 K the conductivity and magnetic susceptibility increase markedly, and at room temperature the conductivity reaches 100 S cm\\({}^{-1}\\), which is comparable to that shown by conventional molecular charge-transfer salts \nThe preparation of synthetic conductors usually involves the oxidation or reduction of a closed-shell molecule to generate a mixed-valence or charge-transfer salt\\({}^{\\rm 1-2}\\) We have been interested in an alternative approach, namely the use of neutral \\(\\pi\\)-radicals, in which the requirement for a partially filled energy band is inherently fulfilled\\({}^{\\rm 3}\\) There are, however, few \\(\\pi\\)-radicals with sufficient stability and flexibility\\({}^{\\rm 4}\\) Initially we examined variants of the phenanely radical\\({}^{\\rm 7}\\), but recent advances in heterocyclic chemistry have provided a variety of potentially useful \\(\\pi\\)-radical building blocks\\({}^{\\rm 1,1,2}\\) One objective has been to generate materials consisting of molecular stacks or columns, and for several choices of the R-group in 1 (Fig 1, E = S, Se), this packing arrangement has been realized\\({}^{\\rm 11,13}\\) By definition, however, neutral radicals give rise to a half-filled electronic energy band, which in a one-dimensional packing arrangement is prone to a Peierls instability (essentially a dimerization process) driven by charge density waves (CDWs) Because the radicals tend to dimerize, we have attempted to stabilize the metallic state by applying pressure and by preparing materials in which two- and three-dimensional interactions are enhanced Several small-band-gap semiconductors of this kind (with E = Se) have been characterized\\({}^{\\rm 11,13,15}\\), but no truly metallic compound has yet been realized \nAn alternative strategy for stabilizing the metallic state involves doping the energy band away from the half-filling which is characteristic of the neutral state We have now found that the oxidation of the 1,4-phenylene-bridged bifunctional radical 2 (Fig 1, red 4) with iodine produces a highly conductive mixed-valence salt of formula [2][][] The preparation requires heating a mixture of 2 (1.0 mmol and I\\({}_{2}\\) (0.5 mmol) in a sealed, evacuated (1 mMTorr) pyrex tube (25 \\(\\times\\) 250 mmol) Slow fractional sublimation along a temperature gradient (225 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C to 160 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C over 100 nm) affords, after several days, luminous silver black needles with elemental composition

columns of disordered iodutes running along the \\(x\\)-axis Perpendicular to the stacking direction the heterocyclic rings lie in dove-tailed arrays running parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis Within the CN\\({}_{3}\\)S\\({}_{2}\\) rings, the S-S (2.066(1) A) and S-N (1.616(2) A) bonds are between those seen in the neutral dimer of 2 (ref [14]) and its di-cation [2]\\({}^{\\rm 2+}\\) (ref [15]), but closer to the former, implying an oxidation state (per ring) of \\(<\\)0.5 \nThe magnetic susceptibility of [2][] was determined between 4 K and the decomposition point using the Faraday technique (Fig 3) At low temperatures there is a small Curie tail due to\n\nFigure 1.1: The molecular structures of the neutral radical dithiadiazole (1), where E is S or Se, and the 1.4-phenylene-bis(dithiadiazole) diradical (2) \ndefects in the crystal Above 180 K there is a steep rise in the paramagnetism, which becomes almost linear above room temperature An electron spin resonance study of crystals of [2][I] showed the same rise in susceptibility, with a large increase in the linewidth from 20 G at 100 K to 130 G at room temperature The \\(g\\)-value of 2.013 was about the same as that observed for 2 (ref [14]) \nSingle crystals of [2][I] were wired for four-point conductivity measurements along the stacking axis (\\(x\\)) Gold pads were first evaporated onto the crystals Wires were attached to the pads with gold or silver paint, for experiments below or above room temperature, respectively",
        "summary": "Summary 5: The University of Groningen and the University Medical Center Groningen are the subjects of the provided information. The content discusses the synthesis and characterization of a molecular conductor based on neutral Ï€-radicals, which play a significant role in molecular conductors. These charge-transfer salts rely on the transfer of electrons between acceptor and donor molecules to create energy bands. The compound combines hole-doped and electron-doped approaches and is prepared by oxidizing a phenylene-bridged bifunctional radical with iodine. The crystal structure consists of columns of the compound interspersed with columns of disordered iodutes. The compound exhibits paramagnetism, high conductivity (reaching 100 S cm\\(^{-1}\\)), and a half-filled electronic energy band. Doping with acceptors enhances the conductivity by facilitating oxidation or reduction processes. The study explores the influence of conductivity, charge transfer, and band structures on the stability and flexibility of materials. Techniques such as electron spin resonance and Faraday measurements are used to study the crystal structure and magnetic susceptibility of these mixed-valence salts. Conductivity measurements provide insights into the influence of charge transfer on the electronic properties of these materials, while the dimerization process and the formation of charge density waves affect their packing arrangement and stability. Heterocyclic chemistry and the Peierls instability contribute to the formation of charge density waves in these materials. Small-band-gap semiconductors (with E = Se) have been characterized, but no truly metallic compound has yet been realized. The Faraday technique and electron spin resonance measurements provide insights into the behavior of these materials. Various researchers, such as C. D. Bryan, A. W. Cordes, R. M. Fleming, N. A. George, S. H. Glarum, R. C. Haddon, R. T. Oakley, T. T. M. Palstra, A. S. Perel, L. F. Schneemeyer, and J. V. Waszczak, have made significant contributions to this field. The influence of charge transfer, bands, stacks, and packing arrangements on the stability and flexibility of these materials is well-studied. The dimerization process and half-filling of energy bands are relevant to the metallic state and oxidation states in these materials.",

\\(h=\\pm\\,6\\).8 around the (006) Bragg reflection The third harmonic at \\(h=\\,9/8\\) was not observed, nor was the Bragg reflection at (106), which is absent because of the body-centred lattice Similar superlattice peaks were observed around nearly every major Bragg reflection in the (\\(\\langle 0kI\\rangle\\) zone, but were not observed around (00/I) Bragg reflections \nThe temperature dependence of the (3/8 0 6) and the (6/8 0 6) superlattice reflections are shown in Fig 5\\(b\\) The onset transition is near 200 K in agreement with the magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurements and is taken as evidence of the formation of a CDW The increase of the intensity of the (3/8 0 6) reflection below the phase transition is quite steep, but apparently second order The increase of the intensity of the second-order superlattice peak below the transition is less steep, as is expected because its intensity should be proportional to the fourth power of the order parameter rather than the second power \nThere is an anomalous 'bump' in the intensity of the first-order satellite near 170 K on warming and a gradual decrease of the order parameter below 170 K on cooling There is some ambiguity in determining the intensity of an X-ray from a scan through a broad, mosaic peak, however similar hysteretic behavior, with a smaller range of hysteresis, is seen in the conductivity This could be the signature of an additional CDW phase transition, but a superlattice from a second CDW has not been seen The CDW wavevector is apparently commensurate at \\(h=3/8\\) at all temperatures in the range 10-300 K, however the low \\(q\\)-resolution of this experiment may have failed to detect a region of incommensurability near the phase transition \nIn a one-dimensional conductor the CDW wavevector gives the band-filling directly[16], and thus we infer three-eighth-full conduction band(s) in [2][1] In our previous studies of neutral biradicals such as 2, the two dithiadiazolyl rings (1) were uncoupled and the biradicals could be treated as containing independent spin systems If this argument is extended to [2][1] then every molecule of 2 is involved in two independent conduction bands each of which contains three-quarters of an electron per molecule for a net charge transfer of one-quarter of an electron per dithiadioxyl ring to give
