Brand & Nicholls, 2011) Recent protocols have been optimized for the selective isolation of mitochondria from specific cell types within heterogeneous tissues, such as the central nervous system, using techniques like the MitoTag approach (Nature Protocols, 2023) \n## Protocol for Isolation of Mitochondria from Cultured Cells\n\n### Materials and Reagents\n\n- Cultured cells (e.g., HEK293T cells)\n- Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+\n- Sucrose\n- Potassium phosphate monobasic (Pi)\n- Tris buffer\n- MOPS buffer\n- EDTA\n- Protease inhibitors\n- Dounce homogenizer\n- Centrifuge and ultracentrifuge\n- Mitochondrial isolation buffer (e.g., IB+)\n\n### Procedure\n\n1 **Cell Harvesting**: Collect the cultured cells by centrifugation and wash them with cold PBS to remove any remaining media \n2 **Cell Lysis**: Resuspend the cell pellet in an isotonic mitochondrial isolation buffer containing protease inhibitors Lyse the cells using a Dounce homogenizer, ensuring minimal shear force to prevent mitochondrial damage \n3 **Differential Centrifugation**: Centrifuge the homogenate at low speed to pellet the nuclei and cell debris Collect the supernatant and subject it to a higher-speed centrifugation to pellet the mitochondria \n4 **Mitochondrial Purification**: Wash the mitochondrial pellet with isolation buffer and centrifuge again to improve purity For further purification, density gradient centrifugation can be employed \n5 **Functional Assessment**: Assess the functionality of the isolated mitochondria using assays such as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements, ATP production assays, and mitochondrial membrane potential assays (Rogers et al., 2011; Divakaruni & Jastroch, 2022) \n6 **Protein Extraction**: For studies requiring mitochondrial protein analysis, use sonication or sodium carbonate extraction to separate integral and peripheral membrane proteins from soluble proteins (PMC9932554) \n### Considerations for Tissue-Specific Mitochondrial Isolation\n\nFor the isolation of mitochondria from specific cell types within tissues, the MitoTag approach can be utilized This involves tagging mitochondria with an outer mitochondrial membrane eGFP, followed by homogenization and immunocapture using magnetic microbeads (Nature Protocols, 2023) \n### Quality Control\n\nIt is crucial to validate the purity and functionality of the isolated mitochondria This can be done by assessing the oxygen consumption ratio (OCR) and responsiveness to mitochondrial inhibitors and uncouplers (Nature Protocols, 2023) Additionally, the use of mass spectrometry-based methods can quantitatively evaluate sample-specific percent mitochondrial enrichment (Nature Communications, 2020) \n## Applications and Future Directions\n\nIsolated mitochondria are instrumental for studying mitochondrial function and dysfunction, which is relevant to various diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer (PMC4401366) The field is also exploring the potential of mitochondrial transplantation as a therapeutic intervention, necessitating the isolation of live and pure mitochondria from cellular models (Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 2023) \n## Conclusion\n\nThe isolation of functionally competent mitochondria is a critical step in the study of mitochondrial biology and the development of mitochondrial-based therapies The outlined protocol provides a framework for obtaining high-quality mitochondria from cultured cells, with adaptability for tissue-specific isolation As the field advances, it is essential to continue refining these methods to enhance the purity and functionality of the isolated organelles, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of mitochondrial roles in health and disease \n## References\n\n- Brand, M D., & Nicholls, D G (2011) Assessing mitochondrial dysfunction in cells *Biochemical Journal, 435*, 297\u2013312 - Chappell, J B., & Hansford, R G (1972) Preparation of mitochondria from animal tissues and yeasts In G D Birnie (Ed.), *Subcellular Components, 2nd edn.* Butterworth-Heinemann, pp 77\u201391 - Divakaruni, A S., & Jastroch, M (2022) A practical guide for the analysis, standardization and interpretation of oxygen consumption measurements *Nature Metabolism, 4*, 978\u2013994 - Fern\u00e1ndez-Vizarra, E., Ferr\u00edn, G., P\u00e9rez-Martos, A., Fern\u00e1ndez-Silva, P., Zeviani, M., & Enr\u00edquez, J A (2010) Isolation of mitochondria for biogenetical studies: An update *Mitochondrion, 10*(3), 253\u201362 - Nature Protocols (2023) Ex vivo immunocapture and functional characterization of cell-type-specific mitochondria using MitoTag mice *Nature Protocols, 18*, 2181\u20132220 - Preble, J M., Pacak, C A., Kondo, H., MacKay, A A., Cowan, D B., & McCully, J D (2014)", "summary": "**SPR: Protocol for Extracting Functionally Competent Mitochondria**\n\n- Purpose: Extract functionally competent mitochondria for research and potential therapeutic applications.\n- Techniques: Cell disruption, differential centrifugation, and purification steps.\n- Cultured Cell Isolation:\n  - Harvest cells and wash with cold PBS.\n  - Lyse cells using a Dounce homogenizer.\n  - Centrifuge to pellet nuclei and cell debris.\n  - Wash and purify mitochondrial pellet.\n- Functional Assessment: Measure oxygen consumption rate, ATP production, and mitochondrial membrane potential.\n- Protein Extraction: Separate integral and peripheral membrane proteins from soluble proteins.\n- Tissue-Specific Isolation: Utilize the MitoTag approach for specific cell types within tissues.\n- Quality Control: Validate purity and functionality using OCR measurements and mass spectrometry-based methods.\n- Applications: Study mitochondrial function and diseases, explore mitochondrial transplantation.\n- Conclusion: Isolation of high-quality mitochondria is crucial for understanding mitochondrial biology and developing therapies.
