This report provides an in-depth analysis of the countries that are currently exporting rubber, drawing on the latest available data and statistics.\n\n## Major Rubber Exporting Countries\n\n### Thailand\nThailand stands as the world's leading exporter of natural rubber. Despite a decrease in production from nearly 5,000 metric tons in 2019 to about 4,500 metric tons in 2020, Thailand continues to dominate the global market (World Population Review, n.d.). The country's exports were valued at $5.62 billion in 2021, making it the top exporter by value (OEC, n.d.).\n\n### Indonesia\nIndonesia is another major player in the rubber export market, closely trailing Thailand. The country experienced a production decline from approximately 3,200 tons in 2019 to around 3,000 tons in 2020. However, Indonesia's export value reached $4.36 billion in 2021, solidifying its position as a key exporter (OEC, n.d.).\n\n### Vietnam\nVietnam has shown a notable increase in rubber production, from 1,100 metric tons in 2019 to about 1,200 metric tons in 2020. This growth is significant, considering the production decreases in other leading countries. Vietnam's exports were valued at $1.28 billion in 2021 (OEC, n.d.).\n\n### C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire has emerged as a growing force in the rubber industry, with production increasing from 800 tons in 2019 to about 900 metric tons in 2020. The country's export value was $1.72 billion in 2021, making it a significant exporter, especially considering its relatively recent entry into the market (OEC, n.d.).\n\n### Malaysia\nMalaysia, traditionally a strong rubber producer, saw a decrease in production from 650 metric tons in 2019 to 500 metric tons in 2020. Despite this, Malaysia remains a key exporter, with exports valued at $1.26 billion in 2021 (OEC, n.d.).\n\n## Market Dynamics and Trends\n\nThe global rubber market has experienced fluctuations in production and export volumes, influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, technological advancements, and changes in demand from the automotive and healthcare sectors. The Asia Pacific region, in particular, has been a significant producer and consumer of rubber, with countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia leading in production (Expert Market Research, n.d.).\n\nThe automotive sector, especially in countries like China and India, drives substantial demand for rubber for tire production. Additionally, the healthcare sector's need for rubber in personal protective equipment has also influenced market dynamics (Grandview Research, n.d.).\n\n## Export Value and Volume\n\nIn terms of export value, the leading countries in 2021 were Thailand, Indonesia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Vietnam, and Malaysia. These countries have managed to maintain their positions despite the challenges posed by external shocks and market fluctuations (OEC, n.d.).\n\nThe volume of rubber exports also reflects the dominance of these countries. Thailand, for instance, exported a total volume of rubber amounting to millions of tons from 2013 to 2022 (Statista, n.d.).\n\n## Market Concentration\n\nThe market concentration of rubber exports is relatively high, with a Shannon Entropy of 3.29 in 2021. This indicates that a small number of countries account for most of the exports of rubber. The top nine countries explain a significant portion of the global rubber exports (OEC, n.d.).\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nThe global rubber market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.0% between 2024 and 2032 (Expert Market Research, n.d.). This growth is expected to be driven by factors such as rising construction activities, the superior properties of rubber, and the development of novel products.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe global rubber export market is led by a few key countries, with Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Malaysia at the forefront. Despite production challenges and market volatility, these countries have maintained their export values and volumes, contributing significantly to the global rubber industry. With the projected growth in the market, these exporting countries are likely to continue playing a crucial role in meeting the global demand for rubber.\n\n## References\n\nExpert Market Research.
