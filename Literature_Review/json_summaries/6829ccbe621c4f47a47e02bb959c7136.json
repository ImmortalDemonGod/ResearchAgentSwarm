Wikidata, a collaboratively edited knowledge base, has emerged as a pivotal resource for structured data, while Twitter serves as a real-time pulse of global conversations. This report delves into the avenues through which one can discover and engage with interesting Wikidata queries shared on Twitter, a task that combines the depth of structured data with the breadth of social discourse.\n\n## The Significance of Wikidata Queries\n\nWikidata, the sister project of Wikipedia, is a free and open knowledge base that allows both humans and machines to access and share linked data (Wikimedia Techblog, 2020). With nearly 100 million items as of September 2021, Wikidata's vast repository of structured data is a goldmine for researchers and data miners (Wiki Education Foundation, 2021). The Wikidata Query Service (WDQS) enables users to perform complex searches using the SPARQL query language, making it possible to extract specific insights from the database.\n\n## Twitter as a Platform for Knowledge Sharing\n\nTwitter, known for its immediacy and brevity, is a platform where users share opinions, news, and information in real-time. With approximately 200 billion tweets every year, the platform is a rich source of user-generated content, including discussions and shares of Wikidata queries (TrackMyHashtag, n.d.). Twitter's advanced search features and APIs, such as the Historical PowerTrack APIs and Full-Archive Search, provide access to a comprehensive archive of tweets, dating back to the platform's inception in March 2006 (Brandmentions, n.d.).\n\n## Discovering Wikidata Queries on Twitter\n\nTo uncover interesting Wikidata queries shared on Twitter, one must navigate the platform's advanced search capabilities or utilize APIs designed for historical data retrieval. Academic researchers, in particular, can benefit from the full-archive search endpoint, which is part of the Academic Research product track and requires application for access (Twitter Developer, n.d.).\n\n### Advanced Search Techniques\n\nTwitter's advanced search function allows users to filter tweets by hashtags, date ranges, and specific phrases. For instance, to find tweets related to Wikidata queries, one could use hashtags such as #WikidataQuery or #SPARQL along with a date range to narrow down the search results (Brandmentions, n.d.).\n\n### Utilizing APIs for Data Retrieval\n\nFor those seeking a more automated approach, Twitter's APIs offer a way to programmatically search and retrieve tweets. The Historical PowerTrack API and Full-Archive Search API are particularly useful for accessing historical tweets, including those that share or discuss Wikidata queries (Twitter Developer, n.d.).\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\nWhile Twitter provides powerful tools for data retrieval, there are limitations to consider. The volume of tweets and the popularity of certain topics can make manual searches time-consuming and overwhelming. Additionally, access to certain APIs may be restricted to specific user groups, such as academic researchers (Brandmentions, n.d.).\n\n## Case Studies and Examples\n\nPublicly shared dashboards, such as those aggregating data for specific hashtags, can offer insights into the historical evolution of discussions around Wikidata queries on Twitter. For example, the #taycan hashtag dashboard provides a snapshot of interactions, top influencers, and the tone of tweets over time (Brandmentions, n.d.).\n\n## The Role of Academic and Research Institutions\n\nAcademic and research institutions often maintain libraries of datasets, including those related to public-interest topics and state institutions. These datasets can be a valuable resource for those interested in exploring the intersection of Wikidata and Twitter (Brandmentions, n.d.).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe quest to find interesting Wikidata queries shared on Twitter is a multifaceted endeavor that requires a combination of advanced search techniques, API utilization, and engagement with academic resources. By leveraging these tools, researchers and data enthusiasts can tap into the rich tapestry of knowledge that spans both Wikidata and Twitter, uncovering insights that are both timely and historically significant.\n\n## References\n\nBrandmentions.
