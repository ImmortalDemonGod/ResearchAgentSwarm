Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a wide range of diseases, from rare genetic disorders to common neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic syndromes. As such, enhancing mitochondrial self-sufficiency and function is a significant focus within the field of bioengineering. This report delves into the recent advances in bioengineering techniques aimed at improving mitochondrial self-sufficiency, with a particular emphasis on nanotechnology-mediated approaches, small molecule therapies, and mitochondrial transplantation strategies.\n\n## Nanotechnology-Mediated Mitochondrial Targeting\n\nRecent advances in nanotechnology have opened new avenues for targeting mitochondria with high specificity. Nanomaterials can be engineered to shuttle drugs directly to mitochondria, thereby increasing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing off-target effects (Zheng et al., 2022). However, the clinical application of these nanomedicines is still in its infancy, primarily due to challenges related to their in vivo distribution, immunogenicity, and excretion. Future developments in this area, such as enhancing the blood-brain barrier permeability of these materials, could potentially revolutionize the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction (Zheng et al., 2022).\n\n## Small Molecule Therapies\n\nSmall molecules represent another promising strategy for improving mitochondrial function. These bioactive compounds can modulate various aspects of mitochondrial physiology, including energy production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, and mitochondrial dynamics (Meng & Wu, 2023). The development of novel small molecules that can ameliorate mitochondrial functions is urgent, as current therapeutic options for mitochondrial disorders are limited. The identification of safe and effective small molecules could provide a broader perspective on the fundamental studies evaluating their effects on mitochondrial function (Meng & Wu, 2023).\n\n## Mitochondrial Transplantation\n\nMitochondrial transplantation is an emerging field with the potential to treat a range of conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, nerve damage, and neurological disorders. This therapy involves transferring healthy mitochondria into damaged cells to restore normal function. Despite its promise, several critical questions remain, particularly regarding the mechanisms of action and practical considerations for clinical application. Interdisciplinary efforts are needed to overcome current obstacles and optimize the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering (PMC10468651).\n\n## Engineering Approaches to Mitochondrial Therapeutics\n\nEngineering solutions are being explored to enhance the delivery and retention of transplanted mitochondria within target tissues. For instance, scaffolds or semi-permeable patches could be designed to graft onto injured areas, allowing mitochondria to reach the affected cells without being washed away by blood flow. Additionally, materials that limit the influx of Ca2+ could help preserve mitochondrial viability and increase the success of transplantation therapies (PMC10468651).\n\n## In Situ Self-Assembly of Peptide-Nanomaterials\n\nThe in situ self-assembly of peptide-nanomaterials within mitochondria is a cutting-edge technique that offers spatiotemporal precision and activatable bioeffects. This approach utilizes specific enzymes and overexpressed ROS to trigger the self-assembly of peptides around or on the surface of mitochondria. Such self-assembling peptides have been used to deliver therapeutic agents like chloramphenicol directly to mitochondria, demonstrating the potential for targeted treatment strategies (PMC8664541).\n\n## Challenges and Future Directions\n\nDespite the progress made in bioengineering techniques for mitochondrial self-sufficiency, several challenges remain. The precise self-assembly of peptides and the characterization of these assemblies in situ are areas that require further development. High-resolution imaging techniques and a better understanding of mitochondrial import machinery and nucleic acids are needed to advance the field (PMC8664541).\n\nMoreover, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial diseases are not fully understood, and current treatments cannot cure these conditions but only alleviate symptoms or slow progression. Therefore, there is a need for detection and treatment methods that are specific to the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases. Multi-omics and artificial intelligence could be leveraged to establish artificial mitochondrial models and screen for mitochondria-targeted drugs, potentially elucidating the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases at the molecular level (PMC9448300).\n\nIn conclusion, the field of bioengineering holds great promise for enhancing mitochondrial self-sufficiency and function. Nanotechnology-mediated approaches, small molecule therapies, and mitochondrial transplantation are among the techniques that have shown potential in preclinical studies. However, significant work remains to translate these findings into clinical applications. Interdisciplinary collaboration and continued research are essential to overcome the current challenges and realize the full potential of these innovative strategies.\n\n## References\n\n- Meng, L., & Wu, G.
