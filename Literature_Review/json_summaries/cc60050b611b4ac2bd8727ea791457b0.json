The isolation of functionally competent mitochondria is a critical step for studying mitochondrial function and its role in various physiological and pathological conditions. This report outlines a comprehensive protocol for the extraction of functionally competent mitochondria from cells and tissues, based on current scientific literature and methodologies.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Starting Material and Considerations\n\nThe quality and functionality of isolated mitochondria are highly dependent on the starting material. It is crucial to begin with a sufficient amount of fresh tissue or cultured cells to ensure an adequate yield of mitochondria. For cultured cells, HEK-293T cells or other cell lines can be used, while liver and muscle tissues are commonly used for mitochondrial isolation from mouse models (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n### Isolation Procedure\n\n#### Differential Centrifugation\n\nThe most common method for mitochondrial isolation is differential centrifugation. This technique involves a series of low- and high-speed centrifugation steps to pellet the mitochondria while leaving other cellular components in the supernatant. The basic extraction method relies on this principle, with purification often depending on density gradient centrifugation for higher purity (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n#### Nitrogen Cavitation\n\nAn alternative to mechanical disruption is nitrogen cavitation, which involves the use of high-pressure nitrogen to disrupt the plasma membrane, allowing for the isolation of mitochondria-enriched fractions with high yield and intactness (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n#### Filtration-Based Methods\n\nFiltration-based methods have been developed to reduce isolation time and improve mitochondrial viability. These methods utilize unique membrane compositions and pore sizes to separate mitochondria from other cellular components (Preble et al., 2015).\n\n### Buffer Systems\n\nThe choice of buffer systems is critical for maintaining mitochondrial integrity during isolation. Mitochondria Isolation Buffer (MIB) and Extraction Buffer (EB) are commonly used, with compositions that can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the cell or tissue type. For instance, the addition of fatty-acid-free BSA may be necessary for neuronal tissues (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n### Disruption Methods\n\nCell disruption can be achieved through various methods, including mechanical homogenization, sonication, or nitrogen cavitation. The method chosen should be optimized to ensure the release of mitochondria without damaging them. For example, mechanical homogenization may involve the use of a Dounce homogenizer or a syringe with a narrow-gauge needle for repeated passes to disrupt the cells (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n### Purification and Quality Assessment\n\nFollowing disruption and initial centrifugation, the mitochondrial fraction can be further purified using density gradient centrifugation, such as a Percoll gradient. The quality of isolated mitochondria can be assessed using assays such as the cytochrome c ELISA or TMRE staining to evaluate the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane and functionality (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n### Yield and Purity\n\nThe yield of mitochondria is an important consideration, as low concentrations can lead to unreliable assay results. It is recommended that the concentration of isolated mitochondria be at least 1 mg/ml for functional assays. The purity of the mitochondrial preparation is also crucial, as contaminants such as peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and microsomes can interfere with downstream analyses (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n### Functional Competence\n\nTo ensure that the isolated mitochondria are functionally competent, they should retain their membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) and be capable of ATP production. The use of TMRE or other membrane potential-sensitive dyes can provide a quick assessment of mitochondrial health. Additionally, functional assays such as oxygen consumption rate and calcium buffering capacity can be performed to evaluate mitochondrial function (Wettmarshausen & Perocchi, 2017).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe extraction of functionally competent mitochondria is a delicate process that requires careful consideration of the starting material, disruption methods, buffer systems, and purification techniques. The protocols outlined in this report, based on current scientific literature, provide a framework for the isolation of mitochondria from both cultured cells and mouse tissues. By following these guidelines, researchers can obtain high-quality mitochondria for a variety of downstream applications, including studies on mitochondrial function, response to apoptotic stimuli, and other aspects of mitochondrial biology and pathophysiology.\n\n## References\n\n- Wettmarshausen, J., & Perocchi, F.
