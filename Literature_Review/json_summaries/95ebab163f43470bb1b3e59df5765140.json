The centrifugation speeds and times may vary and should be determined empirically for each plant species and tissue type - For some applications, such as mtDNA extraction, additional steps may be required to ensure the removal of cpDNA and nDNA contamination \n## Conclusion\n\nThe isolation of mitochondria from plant cells is a critical technique in plant molecular biology research The improved methods described in this protocol offer a more rapid, cost-effective, and broadly applicable approach to isolating mitochondria from a variety of plant species and tissue types By following this protocol, researchers can obtain pure and functional mitochondria suitable for a wide range of studies, including those related to plant growth, development, stress tolerance, and mitochondrial genetics \n## References\n\n- Meyer, E.H., & Millar, A.H (2008) Isolation of Mitochondria from Plant Cell Culture In: Posch, A (eds) 2D PAGE: Sample Preparation and Fractionation Methods in Molecular Biology\u2122, vol 425 Humana Press https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-60327-210-0_15\n- An improved method with a wider applicability to isolate plant mitochondria for mtDNA extraction Plant Methods, volume 11, Article number: 56 (2015) https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-015-0099-x\n- Isolation of Mitochondria from Model and Crop Plants Methods in Molecular Biology, vol 1670 Humana Press, New York, NY https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-7292-0_12\n- A simplified method to isolate rice mitochondria", "summary": "**SPR: Protocol to Isolate Plant Mitochondria**\n\n- Purpose: Isolate mitochondria from plant cells for molecular biology research.\n- Steps:\n  1.
