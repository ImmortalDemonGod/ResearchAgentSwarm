Bryan, K. Barbara Schowen, and Richard L. Schowen conducted a study on the transport of charge and solvation in phosphoryl transfer. The focus was on methoxide ions and their role in the reaction. General base catalysis by acetate ion significantly influenced the reaction. Normal solvent isotope effects provided insights into the reaction mechanism, while linear proton inventory helped understand proton transfer. Stabilization of transition states was crucial for efficient phosphoryl transfer. The substrate's reactivity was influenced by the phosphoryl transfer process. Transition-state stabilization involved one-proton catalytic bridges and distributed sites. Generalized transition-state solvation played an important role. Transition states with exterior concentrations of charge were considered, and isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges were found to stabilize the charge. Transition states with distributed charge were also studied, and charge stabilization occurred through many distributed sites. The study contributed to understanding the transport of charge and solvation in phosphoryl transfer. Methanol, tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate, methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate, and dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate were the relevant compounds. Acetic acid as a solvent and solvent isotope effects were investigated. General catalysis and solvation played crucial roles in the reactions. Phosphoryl transfer, proton inventories, and substrate reactivity were studied. Linear proton inventory and one-proton catalytic bridges were observed. The generalized solvation effect and inverse isotope effects were analyzed. Complete and uncompensated desolvation of the reactant-state methoxide ion was considered. The charge was stabilized by isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges and many distributed sites.

Introduction\n\nA vital scientific contribution of Professor Richard Bader was made already in his doctoral research with C Gardner Swain, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Building upon their panoramic critique of preceding studies in reaction kinetics and mechanism, the chemistry and physics of isotopes, and the spectroscopy and thermodynamics of solutions, Bader, Swain, and Edward R Thornton produced a deeply detailed and complete theory of isotopic solvent effects and of reaction rates in mixtures of isotopic solvents (1-4) Two of us (K.B.S and R.L.S.) count ourselves among those \"present at the Creation\" (or shortly thereafter) and have been profoundly influenced by these and others of Richard Bader's contributions throughout a period now approaching 40 years It is with a spirit of gratitude that we present this paper describing a current application of isotopic solvent effects to the issue of the _Canadian Journal of Chemistry_ celebrating the scientific contributions of Richard Frederick William Bader \nDisplacement at phosphorus at the phosphate level of oxidation is of particular importance in biochemistry, where it dominates bioenergetics, the formation and decomposition of the genetic materials DNA and RNA, the regulation of protein properties accompanying transmembrane signal transduction, and many other vital processes In mechanistic chemistry, the understanding of the mechanism of the reaction remains a subject of vigorous investigation and debate A comprehensive background on all aspects of this broad subject may be derived from the magisterial review of Thatcher and Kluger (5) \nSolvent isotope effects provide an entry to the examination of two aspects of phosphoryl-transfer mechanistic chemistry: (_i_) the role of general acid-base catalysis (where the catalytic proton bridge may be expected to generate an isotope effect), and (_ii_) the desolvation or solvation of centers that lose or develop solvation sites of sufficient basicity to produce hydrogen-isotope fractionation \nBiochemical phosphoryl transfer reactions are sometimes hydrolytic, as in the dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins, but they often involve transfer from phosphoryl donors to non-water nucleophiles: examples include the formation of 2',3' cyclic phosphoryl derivatives in the cleavage of RNA by ribo-nucleases, the formation of phosphoryl serine and tyrosine residues in regulatory events, and the self-splicing of RNA molecules In these cases, alcohols reseracts at phosphate centers are occurring either intramoleculary or within catalyst-substrate complexes \nWe report here some transition-state structural and energetic features of the phosphate alcohols reactions illustrated in Fig 1 These reactions bear some relationship to the ribonuclease reaction just described, although the systems studied here are artificially activated by use of _p_-nitrophenyl leaving groups in place of the alkoxy leaving groups present in the natural systems \n## Results\n\n### General-base catalysis of the methanolysis of PNNN and PMNN\n\nThe rate of methanolysis of tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN) was examined (as described in the Experimental section) in methanolic acetate buffers as a function of both buffer ratio and total buffer concentration Figure 2 shows plots of observed rate constants vs total buffer concentration at five different buffer ratios (the data are given in Table S1 of the supplementary material3) It is not visually obvious but the dependences show a slight upward curvature, probably resulting from a specific salt effect that accompanies replacement of sodium acetate by sodium bromide; thus small negative intercepts with large errors are calculated, as reported in Table S2.3 When the intercepts were constrained to be zero as in Fig 2, little change in the mean values of the second-order rate constants resulted and the rate constants thus calculated were used subsequently

groundbreaking research on reaction kinetics and the regulation of protein properties. Their doctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology focused on solvent isotope effects and phosphoryl-transfer mechanistic chemistry, resulting in a comprehensive theory of isotopic solvent effects and reaction rates. Their study explored hydrogen-isotope fractionation, general acid-base catalysis, and the desolvation or solvation of centers. Specifically, they investigated the transition-state structural and energetic features of phosphate alcohols reactions, such as the methanolysis of tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN). The effects of methanolic acetate buffers, sodium bromide, and ionic strength were examined, including the salt effect on second-order rate constants. The findings were illustrated in Fig 1, which depicted the phosphate alcohols reactions, and Fig 2 presented plots of observed rate constants for the methanolysis of PNNN, highlighting the buffer catalysis effect.

acetate-catalyzed methanolysis of PNNN\n\nThe rate constants for general-base catalysis by acetate ion of the methanolysis of PNNN in CH3OH, CH3OD, and binary mixtures of the isotopic solvents were obtained from the observed first-order rate constants in 1:1 buffers of acetic acid and sodium acetate It was assumed that, as in CH3OH, acetate was the sole catalyst in the deuterated solvents (otherwise an infinite inverse isotope effect for acetic acid catalysis would be required) The first-order rate constants are presented in Table S43 (for an ionic strength of 0.475 maintained by added sodium bromide) and in Table S53 (for an ionic strength of 0.048 maintained by added sodium nitrate) The acetate ion catalytic constants are given in Tables 1 and 2 \nSolvent isotope effects and proton inventories for the methoxide ion promoted methanolysis of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN\n\nIn Tables S6, S7, and S8 of the supplementary material3 are given first-order rate constants for methoxide ion promoted methanolyses of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN in CH3OH, CH3OD, and binary mixtures of the isotopic solvents In a manner reminiscent of the behavior in acetate buffers described above, the plots of first-order rate constants against sodium methoxide concentration exhibited a small upward curvature so that when the data were fitted to a straight line, small but definite negative intercepts with large errors were calculated A reasonable explanation is a specific salt effect resulting from the replacement of bromide ion by methoxide ion When the intercepts were constrained to be zero, only modest effects on the calculated second-order rate constants resulted Values obtained in this way were therefore employed in subsequent considerations The results of these calculations are presented for the reactions of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN, respectively, in Tables 3, 4, and 5 \n## Discussion\n\nTransition-state stabilization in general-base catalyzed methanolysis of _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate esters\n\nGeneral base catalysis of these reactions by acetate ion can in principle occur in any of the following catalytic modes:\n\n(_i_) _nucleophilic mode_, in which the acetate ion displaces _p_-nitrophenoxide ion to form a rapidly solvolyzed acetyl phosphate intermediate;\n\n(_ii_) _prolytic mode_, in which a transition state for attack by\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c}  &

solvation in phosphoryl transfer reactions. They investigate the reactions of methanol with tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN), methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PMNN), and dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate (PMMN). Acetate ion exhibits general base catalysis, while acetic acid does not. The study focuses on solvent isotope effects, which reveal normal isotope effects at high and low ionic strengths. The proton inventory analysis suggests that the isotope effect arises from a one-proton catalytic bridge in the transition state, although a generalized solvation effect cannot be ruled out. The reaction of methoxide ions produces slight inverse isotope effects, indicating substantial interaction with the solvent. The proton inventory for PMMN, the least reactive substrate, suggests transition-state stabilization by a combination of one-proton catalytic bridges and distributed sites. In contrast, the proton inventory for PNNN, the most reactive substrate, suggests only generalized transition-state solvation with many distributed sites. The data support a model in which transition states with exterior concentrations of charge are stabilized by isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges, while transition states with distributed charge are stabilized by many distributed sites. This study provides insights into the transport of charge and solvation in phosphoryl transfer reactions, highlighting the role of methanol, PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN as substrates. The research emphasizes the importance of acetic acid, acetate ion, and solvent isotope effects in general base catalysis. The reactivity of the substrates is influenced by the proton inventory and transition state stabilization, involving one-proton catalytic bridges and distributed sites. Isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges and generalized transition-state solvation contribute to charge stabilization, while complete and uncompensated desolvation of the reactant-state methoxide ion affects the reaction. Overall, this study sheds light on the complex mechanisms underlying phosphoryl transfer reactions and their dependence on solvent isotope effects and catalytic species.", "clean_entities": ["Clinton D Bryan", "K Barbara Schowen", "Richard L Schowen", "Solvent isotope effects", "General catalysis", "Solvation", "Phosphoryl transfer", "Methanol", "Tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate", "Methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate", "Dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate", "Acetate ion", "Acetic acid", "Ionic strength", "Proton inventory", "Transition state", "Methoxide ions", "Reactivity", "Rate constant", "Stabilization", "Charge", "One-proton catalytic bridge", "Distributed sites", "Isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges", "Solvent isotope effects as a probe of general catalysis and solvation in phosphoryl transfer", "Phosphoryl transfer to methanol from tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN)", "General base catalysis by acetate ion", "No detectable catalysis by acetic acid", "Normal solvent isotope effects _k_Bogyl/_k_BOD of 1.68 +- 0.01 at high ionic strength (0.475) and 1.77 +- 0.04 at low ionic strength (0.048)", "Linear proton inventory", "Isotope effect arising from a one-proton catalytic bridge in the transition state", "Generalized solvation effect", "Reactions of methoxide ions producing slight inverse isotope effects _k_Bogyl/_k_BOM of 1.1-1.2", "Complete and uncompensated desolvation of the reactant-state methoxide ion", "Transition state stabilized by substantial interaction with the solvent", "Proton inventory for the least reactive substrate PMMN (relative rate constant 1)", "Transition-state stabilization by a combination of one-proton catalytic bridge(s) and distributed sites", "Proton inventory for the most reactive substrate PNNN (relative rate constant 1388)", "Generalized transition-state solvation (many distributed sites)", "Proton inventory for PMNN", "Transition states with exterior concentrations of charge favor stabilization of the charge by isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges", "Transition states with distributed charge favor stabilization of the charge by many distributed sites", "Phosphoryl transfer to methanol from tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN)", "Acetate ion", "Acetic acid", "Methoxide ions", "Reactant-state methoxide ion", "Proton inventory", "Transition state", "Substrate PMMN", "Substrate PNNN", "Substrate PMNN", "Isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges", "Generalized transition-state solvation", "Solvent isotope effects", "General catalysis", "Solvation", "Phosphoryl transfer", "Catalytic bridge", "Ionic strength", "Proton inventory", "Transition state", "Reactivity", "Stabilization", "Charge", "Distributed sites", "Isotope-fractionating bridges", "Exterior concentrations of charge"], "dirty_entities": ["Entities:", "", "Keywords:", "", "Key Phrases:", "methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PMNN)", "and dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate (PMMN)", "a substrate of intermediate reactivity (relative rate constant 60)", "", "References:", "methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PMNN)", "and dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate (PMMN)", "", "Abstract Concepts:"], "references": "\n\n- S.
