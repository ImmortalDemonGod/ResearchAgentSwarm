These guidelines emphasize the importance of integrity in advancing science and maintaining trust in the published record They cover editor responsibility, confidentiality requirements, conflict of interest disclosure, plagiarism, data manipulation, and author contribution The guidelines are reviewed regularly by the ACS Publications Ethics Committee to reflect current best practices \n### Conflict of Interest\n\nA notable update to the ACS guidelines includes new language for authors regarding conflicts of interest when suggesting preferred reviewers This aims to support the author's ability to suggest experts while promoting a fair and objective peer review process (ACS, n.d.) \n### Ethical Obligations Outside Scientific Literature\n\nThe guidelines also address the ethical obligations of scientists when communicating their work in the press or outside of literature sources This ensures that authors maintain ethical standards when presenting their research to the public (ACS, n.d.) \n### Responsibilities of Chemical Scientists\n\nChemical scientists have a broad set of responsibilities that extend beyond research and publication These responsibilities include the health and safety of the planet, the roles and consequences of the chemicals produced, and the creation and management of chemical products (ACS, n.d.) \n## Safety and Environmental Impact\n\n### Green Chemistry\n\nThe ethical production of chemicals is closely tied to the principles of Green Chemistry, which aims to reduce environmental degradation and improve safety at chemical plants Research universities are encouraged to focus more on green chemistry to develop cleaner and more environmentally benign methods of production (ACS, n.d.) \n### Environmental Sustainability\n\nZagonari (2020) argues that environmental sustainability should be pursued for ethical reasons, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in achieving sustainable development \n## Integrity in Scientific Communication\n\n### Data Management and Stewardship\n\nThe FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship, as outlined by Wilkinson et al (2016), stress the importance of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable These principles contribute to the integrity and transparency of chemical research \n### Validity in Research\n\nLewis (2022) emphasizes the importance of presenting and reviewing validity in research papers, particularly those analyzing quantitative data Making an explicit case for validity allows readers to evaluate the evidence supporting the data and interpretations \n## AI in Chemical R&D\n\nThe application of AI in chemical R&D presents new ethical considerations Researchers must remain in the loop to oversee R&D processes and anticipate ethical issues, such as adverse effects of substances (Springer, n.d.) A conceptual study shows how ethical principles for deploying AI in chemical R&D can foster social and environmental good while considering multiple stakeholder interests (Springer, n.d.) \n## Publishing Trends and Open Access\n\n### Read and Publish Agreements\n\nACS Publications has reached a milestone with over 1,000 academic institutions supported by \"read and publish\" agreements, which provide unlimited access to ACS journal content and facilitate open access publishing (ACS, 2023) \n### Scientometrics and DORA\n\nThe Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the focus on scientometrics highlight the shift away from journal impact factors towards a range of article-level metrics, promoting responsible authorship and ethical publication practices (ChemistryViews, n.d.) \n## Conclusion\n\nEthical considerations in chemical research and publication are multifaceted and essential for the advancement of science and the well-being of society and the environment The updated guidelines by ACS Publications and other scholarly bodies provide a framework for maintaining high ethical standards Researchers must navigate conflicts of interest, data management, AI integration, and environmental sustainability with integrity The move towards open access and responsible metrics further underscores the commitment to ethical practices in scientific communication As the field evolves, continuous review and adaptation of ethical guidelines will be necessary to address emerging challenges and ensure that chemical research contributes positively to global challenges \n## References\n\nACS (n.d.)

The American Chemical Society (ACS) provides ethical guidelines for the publication of chemical research, which are overseen by the ACS Publications Ethics Committee. Editors and reviewers have a responsibility to uphold ethical standards in publishing, addressing issues such as conflict of interest, plagiarism, and data manipulation. Chemical scientists have a responsibility to prioritize the safety of the public and the environment, with green chemistry and environmental sustainability being ethical imperatives.
