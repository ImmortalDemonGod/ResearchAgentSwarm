are essential tools for chemists, researchers, and educators in the field of chemistry and related sciences These representations serve as a visual language that conveys the arrangement of atoms within a molecule and provides insights into the properties and behaviors of the molecule With the advent of computational chemistry and cheminformatics, the ability to read and interpret these representations has become increasingly important, not only for human understanding but also for machine processing in applications such as drug discovery (Brecher, 2008; Willighagen et al., 2017) \n## Chemical Structure Representations\n\n### Lewis Structures\n\nLewis structures, also known as Lewis dot structures, are a foundational representation in chemistry that depict the valence electrons of atoms within a molecule These structures are particularly useful for illustrating the bonding between atoms and the presence of lone pairs of electrons Lewis structures are the starting point for predicting molecular geometry using the valence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which is crucial for understanding the three-dimensional shape of a molecule (Learner.org) \n### Condensed Structural Formulas\n\nCondensed structural formulas are a simplified way of writing the molecular structure that omits certain bonds, particularly those involving hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon This representation is more compact and is often used when space is limited, such as in chemical literature or databases For example, 2-methylbutane can be written as CH\u2083CH(CH\u2083)CH\u2082CH\u2083, where the connectivity is implied rather than explicitly shown (Lumen Learning) \n### Skeletal (Line) Formulas\n\nSkeletal formulas, also known as line-angle or bond-line formulas, are even more streamlined than condensed structures In these diagrams, carbon atoms are represented by the ends and intersections of lines, and hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon are generally not shown This type of representation is particularly useful for organic molecules, allowing for a quick and clear depiction of complex structures Non-carbon atoms and functional groups are usually indicated explicitly (Lumen Learning) \n### Kekul\u00e9 Formulas\n\nKekul\u00e9 formulas are similar to Lewis structures but use lines to represent shared electron pairs in covalent bonds This representation is named after the chemist August Kekul\u00e9 and is often used interchangeably with Lewis structures in organic chemistry (Lumen Learning) \n### Ball-and-Stick and Space-Filling Models\n\nBall-and-stick models represent atoms as spheres and bonds as sticks, providing a three-dimensional perspective on molecular structure Space-filling models, on the other hand, depict atoms as overlapping spheres, which more accurately represent the relative sizes of atoms and the space they occupy Both types of models are useful for visualizing the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule (RSC Education) \n### Connection Tables and Machine-Readable Formats\n\nConnection tables are a computer-readable format that lists the atoms in a molecule and the bonds between them This format is essential for storing and processing chemical information in databases and cheminformatics applications Machine-readable formats such as the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) and Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) encode the structure of a molecule in a single line of text, facilitating the exchange of chemical information across different software platforms and databases (Lumen Learning) \n### Graphical Representations and Challenges\n\nGraphical representations of chemical structures, such as 2D and 3D visualizations, are designed to mimic the experience of drawing structural formulas on paper However, challenges arise when representing delocalized systems, non-covalent molecules, and coordination compounds, which do not fit easily into conventional bonding representations The lack of broadly accepted conventions for these classes of substances can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation (JChemInf) \n## Applications in Drug Discovery and AI\n\nIn drug discovery, the ability to accurately represent and interpret molecular structures is critical Advanced computational methods and artificial intelligence (AI) rely on these representations to analyze and visualize bioactive molecules Various electronic molecular and macromolecular representations, many based on graph representations, are used to facilitate AI-driven drug discovery processes (JChemInf) \n## Conclusion\n\nThe ability to read and interpret different chemical structure representations is a fundamental skill in chemistry and related fields From traditional Lewis structures to modern machine-readable formats like InChI, each representation serves a specific purpose and audience As the field of cheminformatics grows, the importance of these representations in facilitating communication between humans and machines, as well as among scientists from diverse disciplines, cannot be overstated Understanding these representations is not only crucial for academic and research purposes but also for the advancement of drug discovery and the development of new technologies in chemistry \n## References\n\nBrecher, J (2008) Graphical
