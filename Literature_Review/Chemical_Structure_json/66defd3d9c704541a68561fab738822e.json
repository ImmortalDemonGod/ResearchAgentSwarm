[{"file_id": "66defd3d9c704541a68561fab738822e", "article": "Chunk # 0.\n# Overview of Metal-Thiolate Complex Formation and Properties\n\nMetal-thiolate complexes are a class of compounds that have garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in fields such as catalysis, material science, and biochemistry. These complexes consist of a central metal ion coordinated to one or more thiolate ligands, which are the deprotonated forms of thiols (RSH). The unique properties of metal-thiolate complexes arise from the strong metal-sulfur bond, which imparts stability and influences the electronic structure of the complex.\n\n## Formation of Metal-Thiolate Complexes\n\nThe synthesis of metal-thiolate complexes typically involves the reaction of metal salts with thiolate ligands. This can be achieved through various methods, including salt metathesis reactions, where an alkali metal thiolate reacts with a transition metal halide to produce the metal thiolate complex and an alkali metal halide (Wikipedia, n.d.). For instance, lithium tert-butylthiolate can react with MoCl4 to yield a tetrathiolate complex with a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (Wikipedia, n.d.).\n\nIn addition to metathesis, redox reactions also play a role in the formation of metal-thiolate complexes. Thiols and thiolate salts can act as reducing agents, inducing redox reactions with certain transition metals. For example, organic disulfides can oxidize low-valence metals, leading to the formation of metal-thiolate complexes (Wikipedia, n.d.).\n\n## Properties of Metal-Thiolate Complexes\n\nMetal-thiolate complexes exhibit a range of properties that are influenced by the metal center, the nature of the thiolate ligands, and the overall coordination environment. The bond angles in these complexes are often acute, reflecting the divalent sulfur's preference for angles approaching 90\u00b0. Thiolates, having filled p-orbitals of suitable symmetry, act as pi-donor ligands, which can stabilize high oxidation states in metal centers, such as the Fe(IV) state in cytochrome P450 enzymes (Wikipedia, n.d.).\n\nThe electronic properties of metal-thiolate complexes can vary significantly depending on the metal centers and thiolate ligands involved. For instance, a study on group-5 transition metal thiolate complexes revealed that the electronic properties of these complexes change with the metal center, as evidenced by the paramagnetic behavior of a vanadium complex and the diamagnetic nature of niobium and tantalum thiolate complexes (ScienceDirect, n.d.).\n\n## Role in Synthesis and Reactivity\n\nMetal-thiolate complexes play a crucial role in the synthesis of metal nanoclusters (NCs), particularly in determining the homogeneity and reduction kinetics of the final product. In the synthesis of gold (Au) NCs, the formation of metal-thiolate complexes regulates the fraction of various Au precursors, which in turn affects the homogeneity of the NCs. The reduction kinetics by reducing agents like NaBH4 are governed by the coordination chemistry of the Au precursors, which display different reactivity (Nature, n.d.).\n\nThe importance of precursor chemistry in governing the entire synthetic mechanism of metal NCs is underscored by the crucial roles of metal-ligand complex formation. This principle is not only applicable to Au NCs but also extends to thiolate-protected silver (Ag) NCs and ultrasmall metal nanoparticles composed of non-coinage metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) (Nature, n.d.).\n\n## Interaction with Singlet Oxygen\n\nMetal-thiolate complexes can interact with singlet oxygen in various ways, acting as photosensitizers, quenchers, or undergoing chemical reactions that lead to oxidized thiolate ligands. The reactivity patterns of these complexes with singlet oxygen are influenced by factors such as the nucleophilicity of the thiolate ligand and the presence of electron-deficient thiolate ligands (PubMed Central, n.d.).\n\nFor example, Vaska-type iridium (Ir) and rhodium (Rh) thiolate complexes with highly electron-deficient thiolate ligands do not react at the sulfur site but instead undergo oxidation at the metal to form peroxo complexes. In contrast, gold (Au) thiolate complexes have been reported to quench singlet oxygen effectively (PubMed Central, n.d.).\n\n## Biological Relevance\n\nMetal-thiolate complexes are prevalent in metalloenzymes, where they perform a variety of functions. For instance, iron-sulfur proteins, blue copper proteins, and zinc-containing enzymes like liver alcohol dehydrogenase feature thiolate ligands, often provided by the amino acid cysteine. The covalent nature of metal-thiolate bonds in these biological systems is crucial for stabilizing specific spin states and facilitating electron transfer processes (Wikipedia, n.d.).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMetal-thiolate complexes are versatile compounds with significant implications in synthetic chemistry, material science, and biochemistry. Their formation through metathesis and redox reactions, coupled with their unique electronic and structural properties, make them indispensable in the synthesis of homogeneous metal NCs and in the functioning of metalloenzymes. The interaction of metal-thiolate complexes with singlet oxygen further highlights their reactivity and potential applications in areas such as catalysis and medicine.\n\n## References\n\n- Nature.
