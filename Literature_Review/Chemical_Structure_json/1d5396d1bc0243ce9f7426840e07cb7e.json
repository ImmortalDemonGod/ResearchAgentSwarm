Similarly, the University of Virginia encourages students to learn to collect, solve, and refine their own structures through hands-on training and courses like CHEM5380 (University of Virginia, n.d.) \n## Conclusion\n\nInorganic chemistry, with its focus on non-organic compounds, is a field that underpins many technological advancements and is integral to understanding biological systems X-ray crystallography, as a key technique in this discipline, offers unparalleled insights into molecular structures, fostering discoveries across various scientific domains Undergraduate students interested in inorganic chemistry and molecular structure analysis are encouraged to explore the wealth of educational resources and opportunities available to master this pivotal technique \n## References\n\n- MDPI (n.d.)
