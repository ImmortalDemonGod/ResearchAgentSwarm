This affinity is particularly evident in the formation of transition metal thiolate complexes, where thiolate ligands often bridge pairs of metals, such as in the case of Fe2(SCH3)2(CO)6 (Wikipedia, n.d.) The bond angles in divalent sulfur found in thiolates approach 90\u00b0, which is also reflected in the metal-sulfur-carbon angles of metal thiolates Due to their filled p-orbitals, thiolates act as pi-donor ligands, which is significant in stabilizing high oxidation states in enzymes like cytochrome P450 (Wikipedia, n.d.) \nThiols, on the other hand, are the protonated form of thiolates and are known for their moderate \u03c0-acidity This characteristic is crucial in the stabilization of low metal oxidation states, as seen in thioether-metal complexes (NCBI, 2019) Thioethers, which include thiols, have historically been important in the study of metal complexes due to their ability to coordinate with a variety of metals \n## Electronic Structure and Redox Properties\n\nThe electronic structure of metal ions is significantly affected by the type of ligand coordinated to them Thioether ligation, including thiol coordination, has been shown to influence the redox properties of metal complexes For instance, coordination to thioethers shifts the Cu(II/I) potential to more positive values, enhances the rate of Cu(II/I) redox self-exchange kinetics, and generates unusually intense optical bands (NCBI, 2019) This behavior is attributed to the destabilization of the Cu(II) oxidation state rather than the stabilization of the Cu(I) state \nIn contrast, thiolate ligands have been reported to lower the activation barrier to dioxygen binding, increase the ability of Fe\u2212O2\u2022\u2212 superoxo compounds to abstract H-atoms from strong C\u2013H bonds, and promote peroxo O\u2013O bond cleavage (NCBI, 2021) The highly covalent nature of iron-thiolate bonds and the redox non-innocence of thiolate ligands facilitate the delocalization of oxidizing equivalents onto the sulfur, which is vital for the function of electron-transfer proteins and non-heme iron enzymes (NCBI, 2021) \n## Stability and Geometry in Metal Complexes\n\nThe stability of metal complexes is greatly influenced by the ligands involved Thiolate ligands are known for their better stability towards oxidation compared to thiol ligands (NCBI, 2019) This stability is evident in the narrow distribution of stability constants of Cu(I) complexes with thiolate ligands, as opposed to their Cu(II) counterparts The binding geometry also plays a significant role, with tripodal ligands with mixed nitrogen and sulfur donors affecting the electron-transfer kinetics of Cu(II/I) systems (NCBI, 2019) \nIn the case of Cd2+ complexes, ligands with two vicinal SH groups, such as DMSA and DMPS, show significantly higher stability constants due to the possibility of forming tetrahedral chelates (NCBI, 2019) This enhanced stability is confirmed by solid-state structures and studies using various techniques like X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (NCBI, 2019) \n## Applications in Sensing and Catalysis\n\nThiolate and thiol ligands have found extensive applications in various fields, including molecular imaging and catalysis Thioether coordination chemistry, which encompasses thiol ligands, has been exploited for the selective ligation of copper in biological systems and synthetic chemistry This type of binding is crucial for pH-independent and oxidation-resistant binding of the cuprous ion, making it valuable in the development of copper-specific recognition moieties for molecular-imaging applications (NCBI, 2019) \nThiolate-protected metal nanoclusters (NCs) are another area where these ligands have shown significant impact The strong metal-sulfur bond in thiolate-protected NCs allows for fine control of reduction kinetics, which is essential for the successful synthesis of metal NCs (Nature, 2023) Thiolate ligands in metal NCs are also pivotal in dictating the structure, metal-ligand interface, and inducing unique optical and electrochemical properties (Frontiers in Chemistry, 2018) \n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, thiolate and thiol ligands exhibit distinct coordination behaviors, electronic effects, and stability characteristics that influence the properties of metal complexes Thiolate ligands tend to form stronger bonds with soft Lewis acid metals, stabilize high oxidation states, and exhibit better stability towards oxidation They also play a significant role in the function of metalloenzymes and the synthesis of metal NCs Thiols, with their moderate \u03c0-acidity, are crucial in stabilizing low metal oxidation states and are extensively used in copper coordination chemistry", "summary": "Revised Summary (Iteration 4): Thiolate and thiol ligands are crucial in coordination chemistry, forming metal complexes with specific bond angles. Thiol ligands act as Lewis bases, coordinating with soft Lewis acid metals and stabilizing metal oxidation states. They also play a role in enzymatic reactions and can form stable thioether-metal complexes. Thiol ligands influence the electronic structure and redox properties of metal complexes, affecting Cu(II/I) potentials, redox self-exchange kinetics, and dioxygen binding. Iron-thiolate bonds are highly covalent and contribute to electron-transfer proteins in non-heme iron enzymes. The stability and geometry of metal complexes are influenced by the metal-sulfur bond, with tetrahedral chelates exhibiting sensing capabilities. Thiol ligands find applications in catalysis, molecular imaging, and the design of metal nanoclusters with unique properties. They enable selective ligation of copper and the development of copper-specific recognition moieties. Thiolate-protected metal nanoclusters offer fine control over reduction kinetics and induce unique optical and electrochemical properties at the metal-ligand interface.", "clean_entities": ["Thiolate", "Thiol Ligands", "Coordination Chemistry", "Metal Complexes", "Lewis Bases", "Soft Lewis Acid Metals", "Transition Metal Thiolate Complexes", "Bond Angles", "Divalent Sulfur", "Metal-Sulfur-Carbon Angles", "Pi-Donor Ligands", "Oxidation States", "Enzymes", "Cytochrome P450", "Thiols", "Protonated Form", "Thioether-Metal Complexes", "Electronic Structure", "Redox Properties", "Cu(II/I) Potential", "Cu(II/I) Redox Self-Exchange Kinetics", "Optical Bands", "Dioxygen Binding", "Fe\u2212O2\u2022\u2212 Superoxo Compounds", "Peroxo O\u2013O Bond Cleavage", "Iron-Thiolate Bonds", "Electron-Transfer Proteins", "Non-Heme Iron Enzymes", "Stability", "Geometry", "Metal Complex Stability", "Stability Constants", "Cd2+ Complexes", "Tetrahedral Chelates", "Sensing", "Catalysis", "Molecular Imaging", "Thioether Coordination Chemistry", "Synthetic Chemistry", "Copper-Specific Recognition Moieties", "Thiolate-Protected Metal Nanoclusters", "Metal-Sulfur Bond", "Reduction Kinetics", "Metal-Ligand Interface", "Optical Properties", "Electrochemical Properties", "Conclusion", "Comparative Studies", "Thiolate", "Thiol Ligands", "Coordination Chemistry", "Metal Complexes", "Soft Lewis Bases", "Soft Lewis Acid Metals", "Transition Metal Thiolate Complexes", "Bond Angles", "Divalent Sulfur", "Pi-Donor Ligands", "Oxidation States", "Enzymes", "Cytochrome P450", "Thiols", "Thioether-Metal Complexes", "Electronic Structure", "Redox Properties", "Cu(II/I) Potential", "Cu(II/I) Redox Self-Exchange Kinetics", "Optical Bands", "Dioxygen Binding", "Fe\u2212O2\u2022\u2212 Superoxo Compounds", "Peroxo O\u2013O Bond Cleavage", "Iron-Thiolate Bonds", "Electron-Transfer Proteins", "Non-Heme Iron Enzymes", "Stability", "Geometry", "Metal Complex Stability", "Stability Constants", "Cd2+ Complexes", "Tetrahedral Chelates", "Sensing", "Catalysis", "Molecular Imaging", "Thioether Coordination Chemistry", "Synthetic Chemistry", "Copper-Specific Recognition Moieties", "Thiolate-Protected Metal Nanoclusters", "Metal-Sulfur Bond", "Reduction Kinetics", "Metal-Ligand Interface", "Optical Properties", "Electrochemical Properties", "Thiolate and thiol ligands", "Comparative analysis", "Coordination behavior", "Electronic effects", "Applications in various compounds", "Soft Lewis bases", "Bridge pairs of metals", "Metal-sulfur-carbon angles", "Pi-donor ligands", "Stabilizing high oxidation states", "Moderate \u03c0-acidity", "Stabilization of low metal oxidation states", "Influence the redox properties", "Shift the Cu(II/I) potential", "Redox self-exchange kinetics", "Unusually intense optical bands", "Lower the activation barrier to dioxygen binding", "Promote peroxo O\u2013O bond cleavage", "Highly covalent nature of iron-thiolate bonds", "Redox non-innocence of thiolate ligands", "Better stability towards oxidation", "Narrow distribution of stability constants", "Tripodal ligands with mixed nitrogen and sulfur donors", "Two vicinal SH groups", "Tetrahedral chelates", "Sensing and catalysis", "Molecular imaging", "Selective ligation of copper", "Copper-specific recognition moieties", "Thiolate-protected metal nanoclusters", "Fine control of reduction kinetics", "Dictating the structure", "Metal-ligand interface", "Unique optical and electrochemical properties", "Wikipedia", "NCBI", "Nature", "Frontiers in Chemistry", "Thiolate and thiol ligand coordination", "Metal complex formation", "Soft Lewis acids", "Stability and oxidation", "Redox properties", "Electron transfer", "Metal-ligand bonding", "Sensing and catalysis", "Molecular imaging", "Metal nanoclusters", "Reduction kinetics", "Optical and electrochemical properties"], "dirty_entities": ["Entities:", "", "Keywords:", "", "Key Phrases:", "", "References:", "", "Abstract Concepts:"], "references": {"urls": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6602089/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8301228/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal_thiolate_complex", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38955-y", "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2018.00330/full"], "references": "\n\n- NCBI.
