(mitochondria, assessedThe article discusses the protocol for isolating mitochondria from plant cells. Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles responsible for energy production in eukaryotic cells. The isolation of mitochondria is crucial for various studies involving mitochondrial DNA, protein profiling, and enzymatic activity assays.\\n\\nThe isolation process is challenging due to the presence of cell walls, vacuoles, and secondary metabolites in plant cells. The protocol must be tailored to minimize damage to the mitochondria and ensure their integrity. Specificity in isolation protocols is required as different plant species and tissue types have varying phenolic compounds and metabolite profiles. Earlier methods led to contamination with nuclei and chloroplasts, but recent advancements have improved isolation methods, reducing the need for heavy labor, expensive equipment, and large amounts of starting material.\\n\\nThe protocol for isolating intact mitochondria involves several steps. First, the preparation of grinding medium, wash buffer, and gradient solutions is necessary. The plant material is then homogenized in the grinding medium to release the mitochondria, which are then filtered and centrifuged to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet is resuspended in the wash buffer. Oxygen consumption measurements are crucial for determining the intactness and functional capacity of the isolated mitochondria. Evaluation of mitochondrial purity and integrity can be done through proteinase digestion assays, electron microscopy, and checks of mitochondrial membrane potential and electron transport chain activity.\\n\\nOnce purified, the isolated mitochondria can be used for various studies, including protein and tRNA uptake experiments, enzyme activity assays, and western blot analyses. For mass spectrometry analyses, targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) or quantification by dimethyl or other isotope labels can be employed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the isolation of mitochondria from plant cells is a delicate process that requires careful consideration of the specific requirements of the plant species and tissue type. Recent advancements have made the process more effective and accessible for a range of tissue types and species, allowing for a broader application of mitochondrial studies across different plant species.\\n\\nReferences:\\n- Plant Methods.

Usually, four or five washings are enough to obtain a clean BSA isolation buffer. Hence, fill the 14-ml round-bottom tubes up to 6 ml with isolation buffer. The optimal tissue/buffer ratio is 1:3 or less. After mincing the tissue, part of it precipitates and some pieces float because of the air in the air spaces.

            "1. Prepare an isolation buffer containing a high amount of fat-free BSA to bind to free fatty acids.\n",
            "2. Mince the lung tissue carefully, taking into account the difficulties caused by its air-filled nature and the need to remove residual blood.\n",
            "3. Remove the blood, including hemoglobin, from the tissue to avoid oxygen sequestration during O2-consumption assays.\n",
            "4. Compare mitochondrial functional characteristics using three experimental groups: control group (heart mitochondria), lung mitochondria with the same protein loading as heart mitochondria, and lung mitochondria with a higher protein loading.\n",
            "5. Measure mitochondrial respiration using a Clark-type electrode at 37°C during magnetic stirring.\n",
            "6. Note that the concentration of lung-isolated mitochondria can affect the results.\n",
            "7. Use mitochondrial complex IV activation as a loading control.\n",
            "8. Observe that lung mitochondria loaded with 50 mg of protein show less oxygen consumption in complex IV compared to heart mitochondria.\n",
            "9. Consider the possibility that lung tissue yields fewer mitochondria and may require greater loading to generate comparable data to heart tissue mitochondria.\n",
            "10. Note that FCCP-induced uncoupled respiration does not differ between all groups, indicating similar viability and behavior of the mitochondria.\n",
            "11. Use 200 mg of protein per experiment as an acceptable amount for isolated mitochondria.\n",
            "12. Perform other techniques to analyze mitochondrial function, such as ATP production and ROS formation.\n",
            "13. Note that mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, electron leakage, and ROS/ATP ratio do not show significant differences among the three groups.\n",
            "14. Acknowledge the limitations of the method, as it does not analyze all 40 subtypes of cells found in the lung.\n",

            "**Conclusion:** The article provides a detailed protocol for isolating mitochondria from lung tissue. However, some protocol steps are missing, such as the specific composition of the isolation buffer and the exact procedure for mincing the tissue and removing residual blood. Additionally, there is no mention of the centrifugation or homogenization steps typically involved in mitochondrial isolation protocols. Therefore, while the article provides valuable insights into the isolation of lung mitochondria, there are significant protocol gaps that need to be addressed.\n",

            "1. Mitochondria participate in key metabolic reactions of the cell and regulate crucial signaling pathways including apoptosis.\n",
            "2. Several approaches are available to study mitochondrial function in situ, but investigating functional mitochondria that have been isolated from different tissues and from cultured cells offers unmatched advantages.\n",
            "3. This protocol provides a step-by-step procedure to obtain functional mitochondria with high yield from cells grown in culture, liver, and muscle.\n",
            "4. The isolation procedures described here require 1-2 hours, depending on the source of the organelles.\n",
            "5. The polarographic analysis can be completed in 1 hour.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Introduction:**\n",
            "- Mitochondria are central organelles controlling the life and death of the cell. They participate in key metabolic reactions, synthesize most of the ATP, and regulate signaling cascades, including apoptosis.\n",
            "- George Palade and coworkers developed a protocol in the late 1940s to isolate mitochondria based on differential centrifugation. This allowed the isolation of pure organelles with high yields.\n",
            "- The discovery of mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial precursor proteins, mitochondrial ultrastructure, and inner mitochondrial membrane channels followed the availability of isolated mitochondria.\n",
            "- In the 1990s, mitochondria regained attention due to their role in apoptosis and their involvement in various pathophysiological processes.\n",
            "- Isolation protocols for mitochondria from different sources may vary, and specific protocols for brain, brown adipose tissue, and heart should be referred to.\n",
            "- The protocols described in this article are for liver, skeletal muscle, and cultured cells, but modifications can be made by individual researchers.\n",
            "- The protocol for fibroblasts can be adopted without modification for isolating mitochondria from other cell lines such as HeLa and the prostate cancer cell line LnCaP.\n",

It mentions that the protocol described in the article is specific for liver, skeletal muscle, and cultured cells, but other protocols should be referred to for isolating mitochondria from other organs. The article does not provide the actual step-by-step procedures for isolating mitochondria from the mentioned sources, so the protocol gaps need to be addressed by referring to published protocols specific to those sources.\n",

A comparison with defined organelle lists can be used to determine changes in mitochondrial proteins, as long as the amount of contamination by non-mitochondrial proteins is small (<10%) and similar samples are compared, so the type and degree of non-mitochondrial proteins is similar.\n",
            "8. Analyses of protein abundance by SDS-PAGE or other gel-based approaches can be carried out with relatively small amounts of mitochondria (2 - 20 µg), using varying amounts of mitochondria to check the linearity of detection by antibodies.\n",
            "9. While porin (voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC)) is often used as a loading control for quantification, in our experience the relatively large abundance of this protein can mean that the response is often not linear if large amounts of protein are loaded on the gel, so linearity of antibody response should always be checked when using such loading controls.\n",
            "10. The significance of this approach of isolating mitochondria is that unlike gradients that use sucrose as the material to form the density gradient, colloidal density gradients do not require osmotic re-adjustment of the purified mitochondria as is required with sucrose. This means that there is less chance of rupturing the purified mitochondria and after washing to remove the colloidal density material, they can be directly used in a variety of assays or applications.\n",
            "11. Tissue blots, where mitochondrial proteins are detected from whole leaf or tissue extracts, are an attractive approach to measure the amount of mitochondrial proteins in that tissue. Given the generally low volume of the mitochondria compared to other organelles, the detection of mitochondrial protein on whole tissue extracts needs to be interpreted with some caution, as mitochondrial protein may be beyond detection in such approaches. Careful controls, where purified mitochondria are electrophoresed along with tissue extracts to ensure identical migration and linearity of detection, need to be carried out to have confidence in such approaches.\n",
            "12. With the help of a Clark-type oxygen electrode, changes in the oxygen partial pressure of a solution can be measured. The actual electrode consists of a platinum cathode and a silver anode, which are connected by a KCl bridge and covered by an electrolyte-moistened paper (cigarette paper) and an oxygen-permeable membrane (polytetrafluoroethylene membrane). A voltage of 600 - 700 mV leads to the reduction of oxygen, giving a linear relationship between oxygen concentration and voltage. Oxygen electrodes are available commercially from different companies. Each company will have its own instructions regarding the assembly and setup of the oxygen electrode. However, in general, the silver anode and platinum cathode of the electrode disk need to be cleaned with the help of an electrode cleaning kit or an eraser pen before assembly\n",

The first is a step gradient consisting of 5 mL 40% (v/v) Percoll overlaid with 20 mL 23% (v/v) Percoll and then 10 mL 18% (v/v) Percoll, all made up using gradient buffer 1. The layers can be conveniently poured over one another by allowing the solution to run through a 19-gauge hypodermic needle placed against the inside of the centrifuge tube held at a 45° angle. The second gradient consists of 30 mL 28% (v/v) Percoll made up in gradient buffer 2. A sigmoidal gradient self-forms during centrifugation because of the sedimentation of the Percoll polydispersed silica colloid.\"\n",
            "3. \"For isolation of mitochondria from Arabidopsis hydroponic seedling cultures, a single linear PVP-40 gradient in 28% (v/v) Percoll is used. Preparation of this gradient requires a gradient maker, which consists of a Perspex block with two cylindrical chambers connected by a small pipe at their base. One of the chambers has an outflow. Both the connecting pipe and outflow are metered by taps. Two solutions are prepared: a 'heavy' solution, in this case 28% (v/v) Percoll and 4.4% (v/v) PVP-40 from a 20% (w/v) stock made up in gradient buffer 2, and a 'light' solution (28% v/v Percoll made up in gradient buffer 2). The light solution (15 mL) is placed in the chamber with no outflow. The tap connecting the two chambers should be briefly opened to displace air in the connecting pipe and ensure a flow. The heavy solution (15 mL) is placed into the chamber with the outflow. A magnetic stir bar is placed in the chamber with the outflow, and the solution rapidly stirred. The outflow pipe should be secured against the inside of a 40-mL centrifuge tube held at a 45° angle (above the final level to which the gradient solution will reach in the tube). It is important that the end of the outflow tube is held below the level of the gradient maker so that solution will flow by gravity. The taps on both the connecting pipe and the outflow are then opened simultaneously. As the gradient pours, the level of solution in both chambers should drop at the same rate.\"\n",

            "Protocol: 1. If no pressure vessel is available, cells can be lysed manually using a 20- to 40-mL Luer-Lok syringe and pushing them once or twice with as much force as possible through a no 26 hypodermic needle.\n",
            "2. The time the lysed cells remain in the hypotonic lysis buffer before the sucrose is added is critical and should be minimized since otherwise the mitochondrial vesicles will lyse as well.\n",
            "3. Lysis is expected to be complete. Thus, cell fragments, flagella, and floating vesicles but no live cells are observed.\n",
            "4. A white floating layer will appear on the solution. This layer probably represents broken membranes and is indicative of efficient cell lysis; it can most easily be removed using a paper tissue.\n",
            "5. DNase digestion is essential to allow efficient separation on either Percoll or Nycodenz gradients.\n",
            "6. Addition of EDTA complexes the magnesium and thus stops the DNase digestion. Furthermore, addition of EDTA also serves to prevent aggregation of mitochondrial preparations, which is observed in the presence of magnesium.\n",
            "7. It is recommended to load no more than 3.5 × 10^10 cell equivalents on the gradients, although higher loadings may be tolerated.\n",
            "8. The dilution of the pellet with 75% Percoll containing STE buffer in the hypotonic procedure or with the 50% Nycodenz containing SoTE buffer in the isotonic preparation needs to be sufficient to allow the suspension to sink beneath the lowest layers of the step gradients.\n",
            "9. It is best to insert the capillary into the gradient along the tube wall and to keep it there until the whole sample has been applied. First, load a small volume of the sample only and wait a few seconds to make sure it remains at the bottom of the tube. If it floats up, then remove the syringe, add more of the 75% Percoll containing STE buffer for the hypotonic procedure or 50% Nycodenz containing SoTE for the isotonic preparation, and try again.\n",
            "10. Microscopic examination shows that the top band (20/25% Percoll interphase), which is the most intense one, mainly contains flagella and some cell fragments, whereas the lowest band (35/75% Percoll interphase), which normally is the least intense, contains a uniform population of vesicular structures of unknown origin that are much smaller than the ones observed in the mitoplast fraction. Large mitoplast vesicles are seen in all three fractions but are most enriched in the central part of the gradient (25/30% Percoll interphase).\n",
            "11. The main contaminants of the central mitoplast fraction are flagella. Depending on the cell line and the efficiency of the cell lysis, there can be variations in the relative intensities of the three zones. Furthermore, if only little material is loaded on the gradient, then it is possible that no clear accumulation of material is seen in the central zone. Although the yield will be low in this case, it is still worthwhile to collect the zone and to proceed with the purification as a mitoplast pellet may only become visible after the washes.\n",
            "12. Percoll does not mix easily, so vigorous mixing is important. The more the Percoll is diluted, the tighter the pellets will be that are obtained after centrifugation.\n",
            "13. The obtained yields can be quite variable but are typically in the range of 20 mg protein or 250–300 µg RNA per 10^11 cells.\n",
            "14. Although the integrity of the mitoplasts or the mitochondrial fractions during storage at -70°C is best maintained in the presence of BSA, it should be considered that the presence of BSA might interfere with some downstream applications, such as Western blot analysis.\n",
            "15. Pressure will slightly drop during incubation; therefore, readjust to 55 bar after the first 5 min.\n",

If the pestle is very tight-fitting, there may be some mechanical breakage as well. If an excessive number of strokes are needed for good cell breakage, a tighter-fitting homogenizer is needed.\n",

            "3. Do not freeze isolation and incubation buffers.\n",
            "4. The buffer composition for mitochondria isolation and incubation may vary. For example, examination of the literature will show changes in relative concentrations of sucrose and/or mannitol, in the choice of buffering agent and counter ion, the inclusion/exclusion of divalent cation chelators, osmolarity, and ionic strength. The buffers described have been used by our lab for upstream respiration and/or calcium overload experiments and subsequent downstream lipidomics studies.\n",
            "5. Quality and purity of isolated mitochondria is very important, because contamination of mitochondrial preparation with cytosolic structures can interfere/mask lipid profiling results.\n",
            "6. Animals have to be sacrificed, and liver tissue has to be removed and placed in ice-cold buffer as quickly as possible.\n",

            "8. Avoid very fast pestle rotation during homogenization.\n",

            "Protocol: 1. Store the extra samples in a -80 ˚C freezer.\n",
            "2. Mass calibration should be done to the instrument vendor's specifications. On the Exactive in our laboratory, masses calibrations are done weekly. Calibrations are done separately in positive and negative ion modes.\n",
            "3. Tuning of the MS is done to optimize ion transmission through the ion optics to the analyzer. Tuning is therefore performed at the operating LC FLOW rate and the compound chosen as the tuning compound should have similar ESI characteristics as your molecules of interest and should be at the same concentration as a majority of molecules being analyzed. As an example, for our LC-MS analysis, we tee-in (using a splitter) 2.5 μg/ml of PG 17:0/17:0 flowing at 10 μ/minute and 50:50 of mobile phase A: Mobile Phase B at a flow of 250 μl/minute (total flow into MS is 260 μl/ml). The final concentration of PG 17:0/17:0 into the MS is ~ 100 ng/ml.\n",
            "4. Always use LC-MS grade solvents to avoid contamination of mass spectrometer with impurities. To assist with solubilization of ammonium formate in mobile phase B, first dissolve it in ~ 1ml of deionized water.\n",
            "5. Lipids, especially triglycerides, are very hydrophobic and thus they tend to stick to the injector port which leads to carry-over from sample-to-sample. To avoid carry-over, it is important to flush the injector port thoroughly. We usually flush the injector port with 50:50 acetonitrile: isopropanol and 50:50 isopropanol: dichloromethane (10X with each). The isopropanol in dichloromethane wets the needle and prevents drying (which can ruin the needle plunger). It is also is important to ensure that the solvent used for flushing area is miscible.\n",
            "6. The framing parameters in these experiments are set at 0.01 Daltons for the m/z window and 1.00 minute for the RT window; 1000 is used at the intensity threshold. Peaks under this intensity will normally be background or too low to quantify robustly. These parameters can be adjusted based on your own data. A pool from the middle of the sample sequence should be used as a qualitative reference and for relative quantitation, and frames built off the reference are then applied to all samples in the experiment. If a different reference is used, the intensity values may change slightly, however, the overall lipid ratios should be the same.\n",
            "7. For Sieve analysis on the LC-MS lipidomics data, the small molecule, chromatographic alignment and framing and the non-differential single class analysis options are used. Positive and negative ion data are analyzed separately and only the full scan raw data is used for alignment and framing. The framing parameters used are determined by the user. The m/z window chosen depends on the mass accuracy of the instrument used. The retention time window chosen should be large enough to enable correct chromatographic alignment to account for retention time drifts over time, but not too large so as to minimize false positives. We typically use 1 minute for the retention time window and an intensity threshold of 1000 (to ensure that as many features as possible are identified but without picking out the noise).\n",
            "8. To assist with lipid identification of the lipids obtained from the framing data, HCD analysis (done separately in the positive and negative modes) is performed on a pooled sample. HCD fragmentation is done at three energies: 30 eV (Low energy), 60 eV (Medium energy), and 100 eV (high energy). Lipid identification is done by matching the retention time of extracted ion chromatogram of a particular exact mass and its fragments obtained using\n",

            "2. **Objective:** This protocol provides a verified and reliable method for isolating mitochondria from Drosophila melanogaster samples and measuring the activity of MRC complexes I-V and citrate synthase (CS) using UV-VIS spectrophotometry.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Preparation:** Collect biological samples (adult flies, larvae, or adult thoraces) for the measurement of MRC enzymatic activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Sample Collection and Preparation:**\n",
            "   - For adult flies: Collect 80-100 adult flies per biological replicate.\n",
            "   - For larvae: Collect 80-100 third instar larvae per biological replicate. To pick up larvae, add tap water supplemented with sugar (20%) into the vials where larvae are growing and let them detach from the food or tube walls. When they are floating, take and wash them with PBS using a strainer.\n",
            "   - For adult thoraces: Collect 120-150 thoraces per biological replicate. Anesthetize flies with CO2, quickly rinse them in 70% ethanol to remove cuticle wax, and dissect thoraces in ice-cold PBS using tweezers and precision scissors by removing the head, abdomen, wings, and legs.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Note:** The number of larvae and thoraces should be adjusted based on their size and experimental needs. Generally, 80-100 wild-type third instar larvae or 120-150 wild-type thoraces are needed to obtain approximately 200-400 mg of isolated mitochondrial protein. The amount of sample required may vary and should be determined empirically.\n",

However, the protocol does not provide information on the specific steps for differential centrifugation or disrupting mitochondrial membranes to allow substrate access to MRC complexes. These steps may be described in previously referenced methods but are not included in this protocol.\n",

The use of intact tissue instead of protoplasts is a rapid approach that promotes studies in P. patens. The protocol resulted in the identification of two distinct mitochondrial bands, which is a novel finding in moss. The use of plant compartment marker antibodies confirmed the enrichment of organellar fractions with minimal contamination. The protocol also yielded good protein yields, enabling the analysis of sub-cellular proteomes.

            "9. Compare mitochondria isolated using the conventional homogenizer method and the PCT Shredder with pressure cycling at 10,000 psi to assess the ability of muscle mitochondria to respond to Ca2+ overload.\n",

Western blotting confirmed that mitochondrial preparations from both skeletal muscle and kidney tissues were enriched in markers for all three mitochondrial compartments: voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC/porin), an outer mitochondrial membrane marker; prohibitin, a marker for the inner mitochondrial membrane; and HSP-60, a soluble protein localized to the mitochondrial inner matrix space.\n",
            "3. SDS-PAGE gels demonstrated that the protein profiles of control mitochondria samples isolated by homogenizer were essentially the same as the test samples prepared using the PCT Shredder with pressure cycling for muscle and pressure cycling alone for kidney tissue.\n",
            "4. The protein pattern in the mitochondria-enriched preparations differed from that seen with whole tissue lysate, which was not enriched in mitochondria.\n",

The key steps when isolating mitochondria from any tissue are tissue disruption using mechanical methods alone or a combination of chemical and mechanical methods, and subsequent differential centrifugation to remove debris and large cellular organelles to enrich for mitochondria.\n",
            "9. Homogenizer-based mechanical tissue disruption for mitochondrial isolation has known drawbacks, and current methods require extensive operator involvement in tissue mincing and homogenization steps.\n",
            "10. The PCT Shredder PULSE Tube simplifies the tissue disruption process, providing more rapid homogenization than Dounce or Potter-Elvehjem homogenizers, and preventing over-homogenization that can lead to rapid loss of mitochondrial integrity.\n",
            "11. Sample disruption by pressure cycling is a non-stochastic process that exerts identical, non-shearing disruptive physical forces upon every cell in the sample, resulting in well-controlled and reproducible cell lysis.\n",

The integrity and functionality of the isolated mitochondria are confirmed through electron microscopy, oxygen consumption rates, and respiratory control ratios. The magnetic bead method is shown to have higher purity compared to differential centrifugation, as evidenced by the absence of the ER protein marker PDI. Mass spectrometry analysis further supports the mitochondrial enrichment, although a more accurate group of mitochondrial ontology is used to exclusively filter mitochondrial proteins.

            "Protocol: 1. **Mitochondrial isolation efficiency:** Using our optimized isolation protocol, we tested mitochondrial isolation efficiency in four different cell types: human colon carcinoma cell line (RKO), mouse fibroblast (NIH 3T3), mouse skeletal muscle (C2C12), and mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes (NMVM). We used 1x10^7 cells of each cell type and measured mitochondrial counts using Mitotracker green (MTG) and mitochondrial membrane potential (TMRM) dyes. The mitochondrial counts measured by flow cytometry were in good agreement with both dyes.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Mitochondrial isolation and characterization:** We measured mitochondrial amount (MTG), membrane potential (TMRM), and oxidative status (MitoSox) in intact cells and isolated mitochondria. Intact cardiomyocytes had the highest mitochondrial amount per cell and the highest mitochondrial membrane potential compared to other cell types. However, when assayed in isolated mitochondria, both mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative status differences were lost, suggesting that the suspension buffer used for isolation may be insufficient to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential.\n",

            "3. **Transplanted mitochondria and prevention of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity:** Transplanted mitochondria were found to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Human R-mito was injected into wild-type murine hearts, and the presence of transplanted mitochondria was confirmed by the presence of human mtDNA. Additionally, there was a significant increase in endogenous murine mtDNA, suggesting that mitochondrial transplantation stimulated mtDNA replication. Mitochondria transplantation before doxorubicin challenge reversed the functional declines observed in cardiac function and weight loss in mice. Furthermore, mitochondria pre-treatment prevented the increase in cellular reactive oxygen species, decreased mitochondrial oxidation, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiomyocytes challenged with doxorubicin.\n",

            "4. **Mitochondrial transplantation and prevention of apoptosis:** Mitochondrial transplantation, regardless of the source, was capable of preventing apoptosis in neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes (NMVMs) challenged with doxorubicin.

            "The article discusses two methods (Method A and Method B) for mitochondrial isolation. Method B is recommended for samples from brain subregions or situations where minimizing manipulation or increasing isolation speed is important. Method A is suitable for routine preparations with larger tissue amounts. The article does not provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for either method, but it emphasizes the improvements and advantages of these methods over previous procedures.\n",

In this study, the authors present an alternate purification method for isolating mitochondria from human platelets using a discontinuous Percoll gradient.

            "3. Analyze the RNA at 4°C for 16 hours in 12 ml 15 to 30% sucrose gradients in 20 a-sodium acetate/1 mM-EDTA/qo m-Tris/HCl buffer, pH f-8, containing 0.5% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate.\n",
            "4. Determine RNA sedimentation coefficients relative to E. coli rRNA run in duplicate gradients.\n",
            "5. Detect small radioactive peaks not previously detected by absorbance alone.\n",
            "6. Recover only 0.07% of incorporated [5-3H]uridine in the final mitochondrial preparation.\n",

            "9. Add diethylpyrocarbonate, an RNAase inhibitor, to mitochondria purified on Renografin gradients, but observe no effect.\n",
            "10. Investigate the effects of two RNA inhibitors: actinomycin D and ethidium bromide.\n",
            "11. Use actinomycin D at 50 pg ml-1 to inhibit the incorporation of [5-3H]uridine into total cell RNA of C. fasciculata by 97%.\n",

            "13. Use ethidium bromide at 2 pg ml-1 and observe no detectable inhibition of total RNA synthesis.\n",
            "14. Use higher concentrations of ethidium bromide (20 pg ml-1 and 40 pg ml-1) to inhibit the incorporation of [5-3H]uridine into RNA by 12% and 45%, respectively.\n",
            "15. Analyze RNA by sucrose density gradient centrifugation since RNA isolated from mitochondrial preparations would not enter polyacrylamide gels.\n",

Safranin O fluorescence can be \"converted\" to approximate values of ΔΨm expressed in mV using the following three assumptions: (1) well-coupled mitochondria respiring on glutamate plus malate, at pH 7.25, exhibit ΔΨm equal to -180 mV, (2) in the same conditions, addition of ADP clamps ΔΨm to -145 mV for as long as there is ADP in the well, and (3) addition of 1 μM SF 6847 collapses ΔΨm to 0 mV. From these three points, the power function calibration can be constructed: f = y0 + a × xb, in which safranin O fluorescence can be converted to mV. The \"y0\" constant of the power function represents the residual safranin O fluorescence after mitochondria are fully charged; \"x\" is for safranin O raw fluorescence, \"a\" and \"b\" are constants, and \"f\" represents calculated ΔΨm in mV.\n",

Immunoblotting shows low contamination by cytosol and unbroken nerve terminals and low contamination by endoplasmic reticulum.\n",

Add enough homogenization buffer to prepare a 1:10(w/v) homogenate.\n",

While keeping the suspension cold (either in an ice bucket or cold room), homogenize the tissue with the pestle turning at 500 –1600 rpm until there appears to be only connective tissue remaining. This usually takes two to six strokes. When using a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, wear heavy gloves that will protect you in case the glass homogenizer tube breaks. Be sure to bring the tube onto the pestle. The first strokes may be difficult, but they will become easier as the tissue pieces break apart. It may be necessary to pause and chill the homogenate on ice if it gets too warm from the friction. Do not pull back so strongly on the back stroke that a vacuum forms at the bottom of the tube and creates froth.\n",

            "2. \"The only alternative that does not require specialized and expensive equipment (as opposed to ultracentrifugation and free-flow electrophoresis) is magnetic separation using anti-TOM22 antibodies.\"\n",
            "3. \"Therefore, we first analyzed the proteomic profiles of mitochondria isolated by these two fundamentally different techniques requiring only basic equipment: DC and the original Miltenyi Biotec protocol of MACS and compared them to electrophoretic pattern of WCL.\"\n",
            "4. \"As Fig 2 (upper row) and table illustrate, both DC and the original MACS protocols did not provide satisfactory elimination of non-mitochondrial proteins ENO1, YWHAZ, YWHAE, and TPM4 in DC preparation, HSP90AB1 in MACS preparation, and ACTB in both DC and MACS preparations did not show any depletion compared to WCL.\"\n",
            "5. \"Moreover, ANXA2 was enriched in the DC preparation.\"\n",
            "6. \"In general, the MACS protocol performed slightly better, but contamination with non-mitochondrial proteins remained unacceptably high.\"\n",
            "7. \"As the principle of magnetic separation was expected to enable isolation of very pure organelles, we supposed that nuclei and cell debris could be nonspecifically stuck in columns, and low-speed pre-centrifugation was expected to solve this problem.\"\n",
            "8. \"To this end, we added an additional step to the original Miltenyi Biotec protocol – centrifugation of cell lysate at 1000 g for 5 min prior to incubation with anti-TOM22 antibodies.\"\n",
            "9. \"This modification of the protocol resulted in 2-fold decrease in mitochondria yield and would have led to unjustified waste of columns.\"\n",
            "10. \"To overcome this problem, we used crude mitochondria fraction obtained by DC as a starting material for magnetic separation, which was also expected to improve purity.\"\n",
            "11. \"Contrary to our expectations, combined DC+MACS protocol did not substantially improve the purity of mitochondria.\"\n",

            "1. \"Sonication in sucrose buffer was shown to be the best cell disruption method for proteomic studies of mitochondria among many tested options, providing high yield and purity.\"\n",
            "2. \"Chaiyarit and Thongboonkerd subjected cultured cells to sonication in sucrose buffer using a Bandelin Sonopuls HD 200 homogenizer equipped with MS 72/D for 3, 5, and 10 s (50% cycle), and chose 10-s regimen as the best option.\"\n",
            "3. \"We compared this cell disruption method with classical homogenization in hypoosmotic buffer using a Potter–Elvehjem homogenizer, as well as with two extended sonication regimens (15 and 20 s).\"\n",
            "4. \"Cell disruption level and mitochondria yield increased with increasing sonication time from 10 to 15 s, and it remained almost unchanged with further increase, reaching up to 90 mg of mitochondria per gram of wet cell mass at 20 s (mean ± SD = 55.7 ± 13.4).\"\n",
            "5. \"This was 7.7 times more than using hypoosmotic buffer and Potter–Elvehjem homogenizer (mean ± SD = 11.7 ± 2.6).\"\n",
            "6. \"Replacing the Potter–Elvehjem homogenization with sonication remarkably altered protein spot intensities and even the presence in 2D gels, whereas duration of sonication did not matter.\"\n",
            "7. \"We analyzed 22 protein spots whose intensity or presence substantially differed between Sonication+DC+MACS and other protocols using LC-MS.\"\n",
            "8. \"Of those, 21 spots could be reliably identified as containing either only mitochondrial or only non-mitochondrial proteins.\"\n",
            "9. \"Eight spots referred to one or several mitochondrial proteins, and their intensities were greatly enhanced after sonication.\"\n",
            "10. \"Thirteen spots corresponded to 10 non-mitochondrial proteins.\"\n",
            "11. \"Of those, HSP90AB1, ENO1, VIME, YWHAZ, YWHAE, TPM4, CTSB, and ANXA2 became almost undetectable after sonication.\"\n",
            "12. \"ACTB (β-actin), which was very abundant in all other preparations, showed great reduction in quantity.\"\n",
            "13. \"LMNA demonstrated enrichment after sonication.\"\n",
            "14. \"To clarify if other nuclear proteins were also enriched in the Sonication+DC+MACS preparation, we used Western blot to measure abundance of DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, SWI/SNF complex subunit SMARCC1, and histone H3 in mitochondria samples isolated by the tested protocols.\"\n",
            "15. \"We found that unlike LMNA gene products, polymerase II and chromatin remodeling complex subunit SMARCC1 were largely depleted in the Sonication+DC+MACS as well as in the DC and DC+MACS preparations.\"\n",
            "16. \"Histone H3 was present in all mitochondria samples, being most abundant in the Sonication+DC+MACS sample.\"\n",
            "17. \"Thus, the Sonication+DC+MACS preparation appeared to be substantially contaminated only with extremely abundant nuclear proteins.\"\n",
            "18. \"One possible explanation for this finding is that sonication causes DNA fragmentation and stronger destruction of nuclei compared to Potter–Elvehjem or syringe homogenization, thus releasing more nuclear proteins that further nonspecifically contaminate the mitochondria fraction.\"\n",

            "**Abstract:** The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare three available methods for mitochondrial isolation from a human cell line to predict the best method for each probable application. Organelle isolation is gaining importance in experimental laboratory settings, and mitochondrial dysfunction may affect tumorgenesis process. Isolated mitochondria could be considered as an effective tool for assessment and management of mitochondrial related disorders.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Introduction:** Organelle analysis is a powerful strategy to discover the pathophysiology of human diseases. There are established methods for isolation of lysosomes, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. One of the most useful applications of organelle isolation is to determine the localization of proteins within cells. Proteomics analysis of mitochondria also needs pure and intact isolated mitochondria in the first step. The quantity of isolated mitochondria could be determined by assessment of total protein content and mtDNA copy number.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Methods:** Mitochondrial isolation from the human liver cell line (HepG2) was performed using two commercially available kits, including Qproteome (Qiagen) and MITOISO2 (Sigma-Aldrich), as well as a manual method. The integrity of the inner membrane of mitochondria was assessed by JC-1 staining. The activity of isolated mitochondria was evaluated by DCFH-DA staining. The total yield of isolated mitochondria was determined by the micro-Lowry method. Relative quantification using Real-time PCR was conducted to compare the mtDNA copy number of mitochondria isolated by the three different methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Results:** Compared to other methods, the manual kit resulted in higher yields of the total amount of mitochondrial protein and mtDNA copy numbers. Isolated mitochondria by the Qproteome kit showed higher activity. Finally, the integrity of the inner membrane of isolated mitochondria was significantly higher in Qproteome when compared with the other two methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:** Due to differences in quality, quantity, and activity of isolated mitochondria using the three techniques discussed here, the method best-suited to each research project should be selected according to the distinct features of isolated mitochondria.\n",

Enzymatic assays can be used to evaluate these contaminants, such as acid phosphatase activity for lysosomes, glucose-6-phosphatase activity for endoplasmic reticulum, and catalase activity for peroxisomes.\n",

Contrary to well-documented reticular mitochondrial morphology in skeletal muscles, isolated organelles showed a consistent spherical appearance and a relatively homogenous size distribution.\"\n",

First, upon Ca2+ stress, most or all isolated mitochondria undergo mPTP opening almost simultaneously (within 5-10 seconds), whereas in permeabilized myofibers, mitochondria exhibiting a broad range of sensitivities undergo mPTP opening at different times (several minutes apart), causing a gradual and progressive inversion of the Ca2+ uptake signal. Second, we also found that time to mPTP opening was 98% shorter in isolated mitochondria compared to permeabilized myofibers (21 vs 977 seconds, respectively) and the amount of Ca2+ necessary to trigger opening of the mPTP was 42% lower in the isolated preparations, demonstrating a marked sensitization of the mPTP to a Ca2+ challenge in isolated mitochondria.\"\n",

The digitonin isolation procedure is found to better preserve energy coupling in the mitochondria and yield higher ACRs and RCRs compared to the Nagarse procedure. The article highlights the advantages of the digitonin isolation technique for ascites tumor cells and suggests its potential applicability for isolating mitochondria from other difficult-to-homogenize tissues.

            "   - Note: Progressive clotting of mitochondria, nuclei, and cell debris over time may result in marked mitochondrial loss in the 800 × g pellet. Subsequent centrifugation steps should not start later than 30-40 min after initial homogenization.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. \"In order to avoid phase intermixing of the Nycodenz® density step gradient, we recommend slowly layering the 300 μl of 24 or 33% Nycodenz® (for cultured cells or liver tissue, respectively) with a syringe below the 18% Nycodenz®. The phase boundary is slightly visible for the 18%/24% and clearly visible for the 18%/33% gradient.\"\n",

            "2. The volume fractions of mitochondria for different cell types are shown in Table 3. Chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone have the lowest volume fraction of mitochondria despite having the highest weight fraction. The volume fraction of mitochondria in hepatocytes is 0.18, consistent with the findings of Loud.\n",
            "3. Isolated chondrocyte mitochondria consume oxygen in the presence of succinate as a substrate, but the consumption rate is not stimulated by the addition of ADP. This is in contrast to most intact mitochondria, where ADP addition increases the consumption rate severalfold, indicating a transition from the resting state to the active state. This defines the respiratory control ratio (RCR). Chondrocyte mitochondria show strong coupling of substrate oxidation to energy conservation, as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of oligomycin and the stimulatory effect of the uncoupler 1799 on the oxygen consumption rate. Calcium ions stimulate oxygen uptake in chondrocyte mitochondria, and this effect is inhibited by ruthenium red. Oxygen consumption is not observed in isolated chondrocytes until digitonin is added to permeabilize the cells' plasma membrane.\n",
            "4. Rates of oxygen consumption by isolated mitochondria and digitonin-treated cells are shown in Tables 4 and 5 for growth plate and hyaline cartilage, as well as for liver as a comparison. Calcium ions stimulate chondrocyte mitochondria to the maximal oxygen consumption rate.\n",
            "5. The method described in this report allows for the isolation of chondrocytes that retain their cellular architecture and size characteristics. Mitochondria can be isolated from these cells, despite the presence of non-mitochondrial proteins in the preparations. The respiratory responses of chondrocyte mitochondria can be compared with those in situ using digitonin-treated chondrocytes.\n",

            "11. The lack of stimulation of the 0, consumption rate by added ADP in the presence of phosphate, observed with both isolated and in situ chondrocyte mitochondria, appears to be due to a nonspecific cytosolic ATPase activity or ADP utilization.\n",

This consists of a procedure for lysis of mitochondria with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 and a two-dimensional centrifugation protocol to prepare nucleoids based on their large size and buoyant density.\"\n",
            "4. \"In the first dimension, a 15-40% glycerol gradient is used to separate large nucleoids from smaller complexes, including mitoribosomes.\"\n",
            "5. \"In Method 2, we employ a more lengthy 4 h centrifugation step to permit both forms of nucleoids to sediment to a pad containing 20% glycerol/30% iodixanol in order to facilitate their rapid collection and further analysis using isopycnic centrifugation in a non-ionic iodixanol gradient.\"\n",

            "2. The amount of digitonin added is critical since an excess amount will solubilize the mitochondrial outer membrane. It is recommended to start with a conservative amount and adjust the volume added in steps. The amount of digitonin required for permeabilization will depend on the total number of cells being processed.\n",

The nuclei of lysed cells appear as rounded structures, generally with clean margins, whereas nuclei of intact cells will be surrounded by other organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria) and the plasma membrane. If necessary, increase the number of passages through the syringe to increase the percentage of cell lysis.

            "1. Two peaks each of catalase and adenylate kinase activity are seen in gradients representing peroxisomes and mitochondria (lower peaks) and enzyme release at the 30% (w/v) sucrose \"step\" (upper peaks).\n",
            "2. Very little enzyme activity was released during resuspension of sediments.\n",
            "3. The mitochondria released no malate dehydrogenase during resuspension and also crossed the 30% (w/v) sucrose \"step\" without losing malate dehydrogenase activity.\n",
            "4. Adenylate kinase is soluble between the outer and inner membranes of the mitochondria, while malate dehydrogenase is soluble in the internal matrix of the mitochondria.\n",
            "5. The adenylate kinase, sequestered within a single membrane like catalase, is more readily released than the malate dehydrogenase.\n",
            "6. Linear gradients from 15-50% (w/v) sucrose containing 2% (w/v) Ficoll are used, reducing the release of catalase at the top of the gradients.\n",
            "7. The gradients show a separation of membranes containing acid and alkaline phosphatase, with alkaline phosphatase as a marker for the plasma membrane and acid phosphatase for the vacuole membranes.\n",
            "8. \"Heavy-labelling\" of mitochondria is achieved using a tetrazolium dye and succinate. The mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase reduces the dye, and the product (formazan) is deposited on the mitochondrial membranes.\n",
            "9. Gradients loaded with an untreated fraction show overlap of catalase and malate dehydrogenase activities, suggesting that over 60% of catalase activity could be mitochondria-associated.\n",
            "10. After treatment with the dye and succinate, the lowest fractions of the gradient contain red-labeled membranes carrying the majority of malate dehydrogenase and NADH-dichlorophenolindophenol oxidoreductase activities.\n",
            "11. Some catalase is found in the mitochondrial fractions, likely due to peroxisomes being \"imprisoned\" within the mitochondrial aggregates.\n",
            "12. The sedimentability of catalase is largely unaffected after treatment, although the peak and shoulder effect seen in controls disappears, presumably due to peroxisomes in mitochondrial aggregates.\n",
            "13. The treatment leads to a doubling of peroxisome breakage and release of catalase when the organelles enter the gradients. The mitochondria remain intact, retaining the majority of their malate dehydrogenase activity.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Mitochondria were isolated from C6 cells using two different procedures:\n",
            "   a. Conventional procedure:\n",
            "      - Cells were collected with a cell scraper and homogenized in Tris-sucrose buffer (250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) using a Teflon homogenizer.\n",
            "      - The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min.\n",
            "      - The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min.\n",
            "      - The pellet containing mitochondria was resuspended in Tris-sucrose buffer.\n",
            "   b. Procedure without homogenization:\n",
            "      - C6 cells were incubated in HEPES-CH3COOK buffer (115 mM CH3COOK, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 µg/ml SLO at room temperature for 1-5 min.\n",
            "      - Cells were then transferred to ice and washed with Tris-sucrose buffer at 4°C to remove free SLO.\n",
            "      - Cells were warmed to 37°C for 10 min in Tris-sucrose buffer.\n",
            "      - The plasma membranes were permeabilized by pipetting with gentle agitation.\n",
            "      - The cell suspension was collected and centrifuged at 126 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\n",
            "      - The supernatant containing the mitochondria was collected.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. For microscopic observation, the isolated mitochondria were incubated on a cover slip at 4°C for 120 min to allow them to become adsorbed onto the cover slip. Mitochondria still within cells permeabilized with SLO were also observed by incubating cells in HEPES-CH3COOK buffer at 37°C after washing away free SLO, without disrupting the plasma membranes of the cells with pipetting.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was measured using fluorescence microscopy by staining the mitochondria with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a potentiometric fluorescent dye.\n",

            "The article describes two different procedures for isolating mitochondria from C6 cells. The first procedure is a conventional method involving cell homogenization, while the second procedure avoids homogenization. However, the article does not provide complete details for either procedure. The conventional procedure involves cell collection, homogenization, and centrifugation steps, but the specific conditions and durations are not mentioned. The procedure without homogenization involves incubation with SLO, washing, and centrifugation steps, but again, the specific conditions and durations are not provided. Additionally, the article does not mention any steps for quantifying or assessing the purity of the isolated mitochondria. Therefore, the protocol lacks complete details and clarity, making it difficult to replicate accurately.\n",
