### Chain of Density Prompt for Creating Entity-Dense Summaries

#### Prompt Introduction and Objective
You are tasked with generating progressively concise and informative summaries of an text, focusing on including key entities. Begin with a summary that captures the essence of the text and then refine it in subsequent iterations to increase its density of relevant information.

#### Revised Steps for Summary Creation
1. **Initial Summary**: Start by writing a comprehensive summary of the text. Focus on capturing the core ideas of the text while maintaining clarity and conciseness. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.

2. **Identifying Key Entities**:
   - In each iteration, identify any key entities from the text that were not included in your previous summary.
   - A key entity should be:
     - **Relevant**: Directly related to the main story or themes of the text.
     - **Specific**: Descriptive yet concise, ideally in 5 words or fewer.
     - **Novel**: Not already included in your previous summary.
     - **Faithful**: Accurately represented as in the text.

3. **Refining the Summary**:
   - Rewrite the summary to include the newly identified key entities. Aim for the same length as the previous summary, enhancing its density and informativeness.
   - Employ techniques like fusion, compression, and the removal of redundant phrases to make room for new entities.
   - Ensure that all previously included entities and details are retained in each new version of the summary.

4. **Repetition and Refinement**:
   - Repeat this process for a total of 5 iterations, each time enhancing the summary's entity density and conciseness.

#### Guidelines for Effective Summary Writing
- **Clarity and Cohesion**: Ensure each version of the summary is clear, cohesive, and can stand alone as a comprehensive overview of the text.
- **Balanced Inclusion**: If space is limited, prioritize the most impactful entities for inclusion. Do not sacrifice clarity for the sake of adding more entities.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent approach to summarizing, ensuring that each iteration builds logically on the previous one.

#### Expected Outcome
By the end of the iteration, you should have a highly concise, entity-dense summary that encapsulates the main points and key entities of the text in a clear and accessible manner.
