Question:     "Statistical methods for analyzing mitochondrial isolation outcomes",


I cannot answer.


Question:     "Criteria for successful mitochondrial isolation in terms of purity and functionality",


The criteria for successful mitochondrial isolation in terms of purity and functionality include confirming the purity of isolated mitochondria through proteinase digestion assays, electron microscopy, assessments of mitochondrial membrane potential, and assessments of functional activity of the inner membrane electron transport chain (ETC) (Meyer2008 lines 508-573). Quality control measures such as assessing mitochondrial respiration, metabolic activity, protein import, and membrane fusion are also important (Chunk2023 lines 0-0). Preservation techniques such as cold storage solutions, cryopreservation, and HEPES-sucrose-based buffer can help maintain the integrity and functionality of isolated mitochondria (Geiger2023 lines 0-0).
