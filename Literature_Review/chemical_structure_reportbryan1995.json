The compound is relevant to the use of neutral \\(p\\) radicals in creating new molecular conductor materials. The conformation of the dimers, influenced by the steric requirements of the methyl groups, prevents an eclipsed cofacial alignment of the monomers. The dihedral angles between the planes of the heterocyclic rings in the dimers are 2.6 (3) and 3.8 (3)deg. The Se--Se distances in these radicals closely resemble those of the phenyl analog. The study also explores the Se--Se--Se torsion angles and Se--Se bond lengths, providing insights into the steric requirements, conformation, and dihedral angles of radical units in molecular conductor materials. The crystal structure reveals two crystallographically independent dimers in the unit cell, adopting a twisted conformation with parallel ring planes. One ring is rotated on the axis between ring centers by approximately 90deg from the eclipsed position. The research considers the steric requirements, conformation, and dihedral angles of the radical units, shedding light on the use of neutral \\(p\\) radicals in creating new molecular conductor materials. The study also highlights the relevance of the methyl groups' steric requirements in preventing a cofacial alignment of the monomers, and the similarity of Se--Se distances in these radicals to those found in the phenyl analog.", "clean_entities": ["Acta Cryst.
