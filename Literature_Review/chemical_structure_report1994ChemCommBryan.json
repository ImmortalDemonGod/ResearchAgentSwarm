the solid state structure and transport properties of the dimer [S\\({}_{3}\\)N\\({}_{2}\\)CCN\\({}_{2}\\)S\\({}_{12}\\) are reported \nThe concept of using neutral \\(\\pi\\)-radicals as building blocks in the design of molecular conductors' has catalysed the study of heterocyclic thiagyl radicals, in particular derivatives of the two isomeric dithiadiazolyls **1** and **2**.[2, 3] Recently we have shown that both monofunctional\\({}^{14,5}\\) and bifunctional\\({}^{1}\\) 1,2,3,5-radicals can be doped with iodine to form conductive charge transfer salts As part of the development of these new materials a wide variety of monofunctional derivatives of both isomers have been prepared, as well as several polyfunctional derivatives in which two or more heterocyclic rings are linked by a bridging benzene ring.[7] Bifunctional materials with rings linked through carbon[8] and mercury[9] bridges have also been characterized \nAs key structural units the back-to-back radicals **3** and **4** have been synthetic targets for some time The 1,3,2,4-isomer **3** has been isolated as a black powder,[10] but its structure remains elusive This may be related to the known tendency of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiazolyls to isomerize to the 1,2,3,5-derivatives both in solution[11] and the solid state.[12] Our initial attempts to apply an oxamid(s/SC) condensation approach to the 1,2,3,5-isomer **4** were unsuccessful, but we have now discovered that oxamidrazone\\({}^{1}\\) reacts with (excess) SCI\\({}_{2}\\) in acetonitrile to afford the citation **5** (as its hydrochloride) in 15% yield [eqn (1)] The crude detection can be reduced with triphenylantimony to afford the dimer of diradical **4** as a black solid We have been able to purify **4** by fractional vacuum sublimation at 140 \\({}^{\\text{\\text{\\tiny{\\textregistered}}}}\\)/C\\({}^{10}\\) - 2 Torr in a gradient tube furnace to give lustrous blue-black needles of the dimer, mp 275-80 \\({}^{\\text{\\text{\\tiny{\\textregistered}}}}\\) (50% yield based on the crude location **5**) - 1 Mass spectrum (70 eV, EI);

intradimer S-S distance (3.078 A) and interdimer S\\({}^{\\cdots}\\)-S contact along the stack (3.761 A) are also similar to those seen in related dimers In the monoclinic phase of [HCN\\({}_{2}\\)S\\({}_{2}\\)]\\({}_{2}\\), for example, these distances (average values) are 3.11 and 3.76 A.[14]\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the structure is the number and shortness of the lateral interdimer S\\(\\cdots\\)S contacts Many of these interactions, all of which (d\\({}_{1}\\)-d\\({}_{7}\\)) are defined in Figs 1 and 2, are well within the standard van der Waals separation for two sulfurs;[16] collectively they generate a very densely packed structure Extended Huckel band calculations confirm a high degree of dispersion in both the valence and conduction bands \nIn the solid state the dimer is diamagnetic, with a residual spin density at room temperature of 0.01% on a per molecule basis The measured diamagnetism is \\(-\\)90 ppm cmu mol\\({}^{-1}\\) and the 6-value is \\(-\\)0.5 K The material exhibits a conductivity of 10\\({}^{-8}\\) S cm\\({}^{-1}\\) along the needle axis This value will likely be enhanced by iodine doping, as found for other systems.[4, 5, 6]\n\nWe thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the National Science Foundation (EPSCOR program) and the State of Arkansas for financial support One of
