(mitochondria, assessedThe article discusses the protocol for isolating mitochondria from plant cells. Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles responsible for energy production in eukaryotic cells. The isolation of mitochondria is crucial for various studies involving mitochondrial DNA, protein profiling, and enzymatic activity assays.\\n\\nThe isolation process is challenging due to the presence of cell walls, vacuoles, and secondary metabolites in plant cells. The protocol must be tailored to minimize damage to the mitochondria and ensure their integrity. Specificity in isolation protocols is required as different plant species and tissue types have varying phenolic compounds and metabolite profiles. Earlier methods led to contamination with nuclei and chloroplasts, but recent advancements have improved isolation methods, reducing the need for heavy labor, expensive equipment, and large amounts of starting material.\\n\\nThe protocol for isolating intact mitochondria involves several steps. First, the preparation of grinding medium, wash buffer, and gradient solutions is necessary. The plant material is then homogenized in the grinding medium to release the mitochondria, which are then filtered and centrifuged to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet is resuspended in the wash buffer. Oxygen consumption measurements are crucial for determining the intactness and functional capacity of the isolated mitochondria. Evaluation of mitochondrial purity and integrity can be done through proteinase digestion assays, electron microscopy, and checks of mitochondrial membrane potential and electron transport chain activity.\\n\\nOnce purified, the isolated mitochondria can be used for various studies, including protein and tRNA uptake experiments, enzyme activity assays, and western blot analyses. For mass spectrometry analyses, targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) or quantification by dimethyl or other isotope labels can be employed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the isolation of mitochondria from plant cells is a delicate process that requires careful consideration of the specific requirements of the plant species and tissue type. Recent advancements have made the process more effective and accessible for a range of tissue types and species, allowing for a broader application of mitochondrial studies across different plant species.\\n\\nReferences:\\n- Plant Methods.

Usually, four or five washings are enough to obtain a clean BSA isolation buffer. Hence, fill the 14-ml round-bottom tubes up to 6 ml with isolation buffer. The optimal tissue/buffer ratio is 1:3 or less. After mincing the tissue, part of it precipitates and some pieces float because of the air in the air spaces.

            "1. Prepare an isolation buffer containing a high amount of fat-free BSA to bind to free fatty acids.\n",
            "2. Mince the lung tissue carefully, taking into account the difficulties caused by its air-filled nature and the need to remove residual blood.\n",
            "3. Remove the blood, including hemoglobin, from the tissue to avoid oxygen sequestration during O2-consumption assays.\n",
            "4. Compare mitochondrial functional characteristics using three experimental groups: control group (heart mitochondria), lung mitochondria with the same protein loading as heart mitochondria, and lung mitochondria with a higher protein loading.\n",
            "5. Measure mitochondrial respiration using a Clark-type electrode at 37°C during magnetic stirring.\n",
            "6. Note that the concentration of lung-isolated mitochondria can affect the results.\n",
            "7. Use mitochondrial complex IV activation as a loading control.\n",
            "8. Observe that lung mitochondria loaded with 50 mg of protein show less oxygen consumption in complex IV compared to heart mitochondria.\n",
            "9. Consider the possibility that lung tissue yields fewer mitochondria and may require greater loading to generate comparable data to heart tissue mitochondria.\n",
            "10. Note that FCCP-induced uncoupled respiration does not differ between all groups, indicating similar viability and behavior of the mitochondria.\n",
            "11. Use 200 mg of protein per experiment as an acceptable amount for isolated mitochondria.\n",
            "12. Perform other techniques to analyze mitochondrial function, such as ATP production and ROS formation.\n",
            "13. Note that mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, electron leakage, and ROS/ATP ratio do not show significant differences among the three groups.\n",
            "14. Acknowledge the limitations of the method, as it does not analyze all 40 subtypes of cells found in the lung.\n",

            "**Conclusion:** The article provides a detailed protocol for isolating mitochondria from lung tissue. However, some protocol steps are missing, such as the specific composition of the isolation buffer and the exact procedure for mincing the tissue and removing residual blood. Additionally, there is no mention of the centrifugation or homogenization steps typically involved in mitochondrial isolation protocols. Therefore, while the article provides valuable insights into the isolation of lung mitochondria, there are significant protocol gaps that need to be addressed.\n",

            "1. Mitochondria participate in key metabolic reactions of the cell and regulate crucial signaling pathways including apoptosis.\n",
            "2. Several approaches are available to study mitochondrial function in situ, but investigating functional mitochondria that have been isolated from different tissues and from cultured cells offers unmatched advantages.\n",
            "3. This protocol provides a step-by-step procedure to obtain functional mitochondria with high yield from cells grown in culture, liver, and muscle.\n",
            "4. The isolation procedures described here require 1-2 hours, depending on the source of the organelles.\n",
            "5. The polarographic analysis can be completed in 1 hour.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Introduction:**\n",
            "- Mitochondria are central organelles controlling the life and death of the cell. They participate in key metabolic reactions, synthesize most of the ATP, and regulate signaling cascades, including apoptosis.\n",
            "- George Palade and coworkers developed a protocol in the late 1940s to isolate mitochondria based on differential centrifugation. This allowed the isolation of pure organelles with high yields.\n",
            "- The discovery of mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial precursor proteins, mitochondrial ultrastructure, and inner mitochondrial membrane channels followed the availability of isolated mitochondria.\n",
            "- In the 1990s, mitochondria regained attention due to their role in apoptosis and their involvement in various pathophysiological processes.\n",
            "- Isolation protocols for mitochondria from different sources may vary, and specific protocols for brain, brown adipose tissue, and heart should be referred to.\n",
            "- The protocols described in this article are for liver, skeletal muscle, and cultured cells, but modifications can be made by individual researchers.\n",
            "- The protocol for fibroblasts can be adopted without modification for isolating mitochondria from other cell lines such as HeLa and the prostate cancer cell line LnCaP.\n",

It mentions that the protocol described in the article is specific for liver, skeletal muscle, and cultured cells, but other protocols should be referred to for isolating mitochondria from other organs. The article does not provide the actual step-by-step procedures for isolating mitochondria from the mentioned sources, so the protocol gaps need to be addressed by referring to published protocols specific to those sources.\n",

A comparison with defined organelle lists can be used to determine changes in mitochondrial proteins, as long as the amount of contamination by non-mitochondrial proteins is small (<10%) and similar samples are compared, so the type and degree of non-mitochondrial proteins is similar.\n",
            "8. Analyses of protein abundance by SDS-PAGE or other gel-based approaches can be carried out with relatively small amounts of mitochondria (2 - 20 µg), using varying amounts of mitochondria to check the linearity of detection by antibodies.\n",
            "9. While porin (voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC)) is often used as a loading control for quantification, in our experience the relatively large abundance of this protein can mean that the response is often not linear if large amounts of protein are loaded on the gel, so linearity of antibody response should always be checked when using such loading controls.\n",
            "10. The significance of this approach of isolating mitochondria is that unlike gradients that use sucrose as the material to form the density gradient, colloidal density gradients do not require osmotic re-adjustment of the purified mitochondria as is required with sucrose. This means that there is less chance of rupturing the purified mitochondria and after washing to remove the colloidal density material, they can be directly used in a variety of assays or applications.\n",
            "11. Tissue blots, where mitochondrial proteins are detected from whole leaf or tissue extracts, are an attractive approach to measure the amount of mitochondrial proteins in that tissue. Given the generally low volume of the mitochondria compared to other organelles, the detection of mitochondrial protein on whole tissue extracts needs to be interpreted with some caution, as mitochondrial protein may be beyond detection in such approaches. Careful controls, where purified mitochondria are electrophoresed along with tissue extracts to ensure identical migration and linearity of detection, need to be carried out to have confidence in such approaches.\n",
            "12. With the help of a Clark-type oxygen electrode, changes in the oxygen partial pressure of a solution can be measured. The actual electrode consists of a platinum cathode and a silver anode, which are connected by a KCl bridge and covered by an electrolyte-moistened paper (cigarette paper) and an oxygen-permeable membrane (polytetrafluoroethylene membrane). A voltage of 600 - 700 mV leads to the reduction of oxygen, giving a linear relationship between oxygen concentration and voltage. Oxygen electrodes are available commercially from different companies. Each company will have its own instructions regarding the assembly and setup of the oxygen electrode. However, in general, the silver anode and platinum cathode of the electrode disk need to be cleaned with the help of an electrode cleaning kit or an eraser pen before assembly\n",

The first is a step gradient consisting of 5 mL 40% (v/v) Percoll overlaid with 20 mL 23% (v/v) Percoll and then 10 mL 18% (v/v) Percoll, all made up using gradient buffer 1. The layers can be conveniently poured over one another by allowing the solution to run through a 19-gauge hypodermic needle placed against the inside of the centrifuge tube held at a 45° angle. The second gradient consists of 30 mL 28% (v/v) Percoll made up in gradient buffer 2. A sigmoidal gradient self-forms during centrifugation because of the sedimentation of the Percoll polydispersed silica colloid.\"\n",
            "3. \"For isolation of mitochondria from Arabidopsis hydroponic seedling cultures, a single linear PVP-40 gradient in 28% (v/v) Percoll is used. Preparation of this gradient requires a gradient maker, which consists of a Perspex block with two cylindrical chambers connected by a small pipe at their base. One of the chambers has an outflow. Both the connecting pipe and outflow are metered by taps. Two solutions are prepared: a 'heavy' solution, in this case 28% (v/v) Percoll and 4.4% (v/v) PVP-40 from a 20% (w/v) stock made up in gradient buffer 2, and a 'light' solution (28% v/v Percoll made up in gradient buffer 2). The light solution (15 mL) is placed in the chamber with no outflow. The tap connecting the two chambers should be briefly opened to displace air in the connecting pipe and ensure a flow. The heavy solution (15 mL) is placed into the chamber with the outflow. A magnetic stir bar is placed in the chamber with the outflow, and the solution rapidly stirred. The outflow pipe should be secured against the inside of a 40-mL centrifuge tube held at a 45° angle (above the final level to which the gradient solution will reach in the tube). It is important that the end of the outflow tube is held below the level of the gradient maker so that solution will flow by gravity. The taps on both the connecting pipe and the outflow are then opened simultaneously. As the gradient pours, the level of solution in both chambers should drop at the same rate.\"\n",

            "Protocol: 1. If no pressure vessel is available, cells can be lysed manually using a 20- to 40-mL Luer-Lok syringe and pushing them once or twice with as much force as possible through a no 26 hypodermic needle.\n",
            "2. The time the lysed cells remain in the hypotonic lysis buffer before the sucrose is added is critical and should be minimized since otherwise the mitochondrial vesicles will lyse as well.\n",
            "3. Lysis is expected to be complete. Thus, cell fragments, flagella, and floating vesicles but no live cells are observed.\n",
            "4. A white floating layer will appear on the solution. This layer probably represents broken membranes and is indicative of efficient cell lysis; it can most easily be removed using a paper tissue.\n",
            "5. DNase digestion is essential to allow efficient separation on either Percoll or Nycodenz gradients.\n",
            "6. Addition of EDTA complexes the magnesium and thus stops the DNase digestion. Furthermore, addition of EDTA also serves to prevent aggregation of mitochondrial preparations, which is observed in the presence of magnesium.\n",
            "7. It is recommended to load no more than 3.5 × 10^10 cell equivalents on the gradients, although higher loadings may be tolerated.\n",
            "8. The dilution of the pellet with 75% Percoll containing STE buffer in the hypotonic procedure or with the 50% Nycodenz containing SoTE buffer in the isotonic preparation needs to be sufficient to allow the suspension to sink beneath the lowest layers of the step gradients.\n",
            "9. It is best to insert the capillary into the gradient along the tube wall and to keep it there until the whole sample has been applied. First, load a small volume of the sample only and wait a few seconds to make sure it remains at the bottom of the tube. If it floats up, then remove the syringe, add more of the 75% Percoll containing STE buffer for the hypotonic procedure or 50% Nycodenz containing SoTE for the isotonic preparation, and try again.\n",
            "10. Microscopic examination shows that the top band (20/25% Percoll interphase), which is the most intense one, mainly contains flagella and some cell fragments, whereas the lowest band (35/75% Percoll interphase), which normally is the least intense, contains a uniform population of vesicular structures of unknown origin that are much smaller than the ones observed in the mitoplast fraction. Large mitoplast vesicles are seen in all three fractions but are most enriched in the central part of the gradient (25/30% Percoll interphase).\n",
            "11. The main contaminants of the central mitoplast fraction are flagella. Depending on the cell line and the efficiency of the cell lysis, there can be variations in the relative intensities of the three zones. Furthermore, if only little material is loaded on the gradient, then it is possible that no clear accumulation of material is seen in the central zone. Although the yield will be low in this case, it is still worthwhile to collect the zone and to proceed with the purification as a mitoplast pellet may only become visible after the washes.\n",
            "12. Percoll does not mix easily, so vigorous mixing is important. The more the Percoll is diluted, the tighter the pellets will be that are obtained after centrifugation.\n",
            "13. The obtained yields can be quite variable but are typically in the range of 20 mg protein or 250–300 µg RNA per 10^11 cells.\n",
            "14. Although the integrity of the mitoplasts or the mitochondrial fractions during storage at -70°C is best maintained in the presence of BSA, it should be considered that the presence of BSA might interfere with some downstream applications, such as Western blot analysis.\n",
            "15. Pressure will slightly drop during incubation; therefore, readjust to 55 bar after the first 5 min.\n",

If the pestle is very tight-fitting, there may be some mechanical breakage as well. If an excessive number of strokes are needed for good cell breakage, a tighter-fitting homogenizer is needed.\n",
