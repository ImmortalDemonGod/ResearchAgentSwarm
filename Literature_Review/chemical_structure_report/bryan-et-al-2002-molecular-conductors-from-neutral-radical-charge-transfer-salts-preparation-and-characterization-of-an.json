        "summary": "Revised Summary (Iteration 3): Molecular conductors, specifically neutral-radical charge-transfer salts, have been extensively studied by researchers from the University of Arkansas, AT&T Bell Laboratories, University of Guelph, and other institutions. These salts exhibit various crystal phases, including the hexagonal and triclinic phases. The crystal structures of these materials consist of stacked dimers and columnar structures, with iodine atoms residing within the columnar cavity. The conductivity of the doped material has been demonstrated in single-crystal form at room temperature, as measured by Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The synthesis of organic conductors involves oxidation or reduction reactions, utilizing donors like tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and acceptors such as tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and C60. These materials can stabilize the metallic state under pressure and exhibit charge density wave (CDW) phenomena. Crystal packing plays a crucial role in the conductivity of these charge-transfer salts, and their crystal structures can be modified through sublimation or inclusion of other compounds.",

        "article": "Chunk # 1.\nHerein we describe the preparation and crystal structures of both the triclinic and doped hexagonal phases and report the magnetic and conductivity characteristics of the doped material \n## Results\n\n### Preparation and Doping of Triclinic [HCN2S2]2 \nIn our earlier report of the characterization of the monoclinic phase of [HCN2S2]2, we noted that the conditions for crystal growth involved sublimation of the radical under an atmosphere of argon In practice the samples were heated in sealed tubes subjected to a gentle temperature gradient from 70 to 20 degC An alternative method for crystal growth, indeed the one most commonly used for bulk sample purification, involves sublimation of the radical _in vacuo_ (typically 10-2 Torr) Under these pressure conditions a temperature gradient of 30-0 degC (ice/water) is usually employed The crystalline needles so obtained are thinner, and more fibrous, than those obtained by the 1-atm sublimation, and structural (X-ray) characterization required the selection and preliminary analysis of many crystals The samples were usually collected after flooding the sublimer with dry nitrogen, and this could account for the inclusion of trace quantities of what may be dinitrogen (_vide infra_) into the lattice \nThe reactions of 1 with iodine were carried out in sealed, evacuated tubes The reagents (either the monoclinic or the triclinic phase of the dimer 2) were vaporized along a temperature gradient from 70 to 30 degC, and the tube was then reversed and the sublimate re-evaporated After several (at least six) passes, a relatively homogeneous selection of lustrous silver-black hexagonal crystals was produced In early experiments the two reagents were introduced in a ratio of 6:1 ([HCN2S2]:I), but after repeated chemical and crystallographic analyses of the best samples (see Experimental Section), which established the level of loading of iodine in the doped material, the stoichiometry of mixing was eventually adjusted to 5:1 The crystals so obtained were harvested in an argon-filled drybox Although they are relatively air-sensitive, losing their luster after 2-3 min of exposure, they could be handled for shorter periods in dry air (for X-ray crystal mounting purposes) \n### Crystal Structure of Triclinic [HCN2S2]2 \nAtomic coordinates for the triclinic phase of [HCN2S2]2 are provided in Table 1, and a summary of pertinent bond lengths is presented in Table 2 Like the case of monoclinic phase, the structure of the triclinic phase also consists of stacked dimers, with three dimers in the asymmetric unit Figure 1 illustrates the stacking of the asymmetric units in the \\(x\\) direction The intradimer-S- distance (mean 3.103 A), and the interdimer S-*-S contacts along the stack (mean 3.786 A) are comparable to those seen in the monoclinic structure The internal ring bonds and angles are also very similar \nThe major difference between the two phases can be appreciated when the two structures are viewed down the stacking direction In both the triclinic and monoclinic phases the stacks associate into groups of six, each comprised of two centrosymmetrically related sets of the three crystallographically independent dimers In the monoclinic crystal these six-stack groups have an irregular cross section which represents efficient space filling.10 By contrast the six-stack groups of the triclinic phase resemble a pinwheel or \"mercry-go-round\" motif (Figure 2) The three-dimensional structure thus consists of a series of molecular tubes, inside of which there is a strikingly large cavity",
        "summary": "Summary (Iteration 7):\nCrystal structures of triclinic and doped hexagonal phases of [HCN2S2]2 were prepared and characterized. The doped material exhibited magnetic and conductivity characteristics. The triclinic phase was obtained through sublimation under an argon atmosphere, involving crystal growth in sealed tubes with a temperature gradient from 70 to 20 degC. The crystals obtained under vacuum conditions had a thinner and more fibrous morphology. X-ray crystallographic analyses were conducted to determine atomic coordinates, bond lengths, and angles. The triclinic phase showed stacked dimers with comparable bonds to the monoclinic phase. It formed a pinwheel or \"mercy-go-round\" motif in its three-dimensional structure, consisting of molecular tubes with a strikingly large cavity. The crystal growth of the triclinic phase involved loading in air-sensitive conditions and resulted in efficient space filling. The lustrous silver-black hexagonal crystals of the doped material were analyzed for their structural properties. The intradimer-S- distance and interdimer S-*-S contacts were observed in the crystal structures, and the crystals were used for X-ray crystal mounting purposes. The preparation of crystalline needles involved the use of iodine and sublimation under vacuum conditions (10-2 Torr). The crystal structures revealed the presence of stacks with internal ring bonds, and the stacking of asymmetric units was discussed in our earlier report. Stoichiometry was adjusted to a 5:1 ratio of [HCN2S2]2 to iodine during the crystal growth process.",

        "summary": "The columnar cavity size is estimated based on the perpendicular distances of the innermost sulfur atoms of the three dimer units to the I axis. The range of these distances is from 3.309 A (S7) to 3.985 A (S4), with an average of 3.715 A. Consequently, the average diameter of the cavity is 7.43 A. The molecular tubes are arranged in a close-packed configuration, resembling a near-hexagonal crystal symmetry. Within these tubes, two centers of electron density were identified and represented by nitrogen atoms with fractional occupancies.",

        "article": "Chunk # 6.\nThe size of the columnar cavity can be estimated in terms of the perpendicular distances of the outermost sulfur atoms of the three dimer units to the I axis; these values range from a low of 3.309 A (for S7) to a high of 3.985 A (S4) with an average of 3.715 A; the average diameter of the cavity is thus 7.43 A The molecular tubes are locked in a close-packed arrangement, e.g., 3, which constitutes a near-hexagonal crystal symmetry Three series of close S- - S structure two centers of electron density were located within these tubes and were eventually modeled by nitrogen atoms with fractional occupancies (see Experimental Section) The size of the columnar cavity can be estimated in terms of the perpendicular distances of the outermost sulfur atoms of the three dimer units to the I axis; these values range from a low 3.3feature of the doped structure is the molecular repeat distance, the unit cell dimension \\(a\\), which is now 3.352(S) A, i.e., the heterocyclic HCN_S_2 rings are uniformly spaced The internal diameter of the tubes, defined as twice the distance from the innermost sulfur (S2) to the 61 axis, is 7.40 A, i.e., very similar to that observed in the undoped structure \nIodine atoms are incorporated into the columnar cavities and are disordered The disorder model presented here essentially distributes the electron density of the iodines evenly along the cavities The 61 symmetry, the 3.352 A cell repeat, and the sites used give a tight spiral of iodine positions which are separated by about 0.5 A both horizontally and vertically, with a spiral diameter of less than 1 A Many crystals of this material were examined, and a total of four data sets were collected The data and the iodine occupancies presented here are from the best refinement In the other data sets the occupancy varied from a low of 0.18 to a high of 0.22 The reported value corresponds to an iodine loading of 1.1 iodines per six [HCN_S_2] units and is in good agreement with the results of repeated chemical analyses on different samples \n### Raman Spectra of [HCN_S_2] and [HCN_S_2][I]1.1\n\nIn order to probe further the structural changes associated with iodine incorporation, we have recorded the Raman spectra of the parent compound [HCN_S_2]2 (triclinic phase) and its iodine-doped derivative [HCN_S_2]2[I]1.1 (Figure 5) In the undoped material, clear, well-resolved bands are observed throughout the entire vibrational region; a complete listing of the observed Raman bands is provided in the Experimental Section.12 For the doped material, however, scattering associated with iodine dominates the spectrum, and only two broad bands, at 107 and 148 cm-1, are observed In the undoped compound the most notable feature, within the present context, is the strong, broad band centered at 124 cm-1 In our recent analysis of the gas-phase vibrational spectrum of [HCN_S_2]2 (1), we determined (from _ab initio_ frequency calculations) that the lowest vibrational modes should occur near 475 cm-1 (A1 symmetry) and 219 cm-1 (A2 symmetry).10 Of these, the former, which is loosely associated with the internal S-S bond, is predicted to be very strong in the Raman spectrum; the latter is predicted to be vanishingly weak.13 Dimerization of the radical perturbs the gas-phase structure only slightly,10 from which we conclude that the observed band at 463 cm-1 in triclinic [HCN_S_2]2 is still largely an intra-annular S-S stretch Because there are no predicted Raman-active intra-annular modes below the 400-cm-1 region, we assign the band centered at 124 cm-1 to interannular S- -S vibrations which are broadened by lattice coupling effects We do not, however, venture beyond qualitative assignments of the two Raman bands in [HCN_S_2]2[I]1.1 One or both may involve the internal stretching modes of a linear polyiodide species.14 In benzophenone/iodine/potassium iodide (BIKI),15 for example, the disordered iodines also occupy a hexagonal cavity,16 and the resonance Raman spectrum displays broad bands at 167 and 108 cm-1.17 However, the possibility that weak S - -S or even S - -1 interactions are involved in the present system cannot be discounted \nIn spite of these uncertainties surrounding the low-frequency region, we can conclude that at both room (295 K) and low (130 K) temperature there is partial charge transfer from iodine to radical, i.e., the encapsulated iodine is in the form of a polyiodide We refrain, however, from formal assessment of the degree of charge transfer The subtle changes observed on cooling the doped material, i.e., the increase in the intensity of the higher frequency band, may be indicative of a subtle change in charge transfer and may also signal the onset of some association of the rings (see the magnetic measurements below) \n### Magnetic and Conductivity Measurements \nThe measured magnetic susceptibility of [HCN_S_2]2[I]1.1 as a function of temperature is shown in Figure 6",
        "summary": "The columnar cavity size is estimated based on the distances of the outermost sulfur atoms of the dimer units to the I axis, ranging from 3.309 A to 3.985 A, with an average of 3.715 A. The average diameter of the cavity is 7.43 A. The molecular tubes are arranged in a close-packed near-hexagonal crystal symmetry. Two centers of electron density, modeled by nitrogen atoms, are located within these tubes. The doped structure has a molecular repeat distance of 3.352 A. Iodine atoms are incorporated into the cavities in a disordered manner, distributed evenly along the cavities. The iodine loading corresponds to 1.1 iodines per six [HCN_S_2] units. Raman spectra of the undoped and iodine-doped compounds show significant changes, with iodine dominating the spectrum in the doped compound. The observed bands in the undoped compound suggest interannular S-S vibrations. The doped compound exhibits partial charge transfer from iodine to the radical. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of the doped compound show temperature dependence.",

        "article": "Chunk # 7.\nAs in the case of [1,4-(S_2N2C)-C_H_H_H_C(S_2)]1.3 the concentration of spin-bearing defects is very low (0.01% per molecule), and at low temperatures the material is diamagnetic (confirmed by ESR) A pronounced spin susceptibility begins to develop at about 180 K, and the sample paramagnetism continues to increase to the highest temperatures attainable (before sample decomposition) Similar behavior was seen for [1,4-(S_2N2C)C_H_H_C(S_2)]1 [I], except that in that case the rise in susceptibility slowed above room\n\nFigure 4.: Internal rearrangement of columnar cavities in [HCN_S_2]2 occasional by iodine doping The nearly horizontal connectivity lines on the left, and the spiral connectivity lines on the right, are defined in Table 2 \nFigure 5.: Raman spectra of triclinic [HCN_S_2]2 (above) and [HCN_S_2]2 (I)1.1 (below) Inserts are magnifications of the 300–50–cm−1 region For the doped material two temperatures are shown: 295 K (solid line) and 130 K (dashed line) The spike near 2800 cm−1 in the lower spectrum is of instrumental origin \ntemperature.9 Furthermore, the two inflection points seen in the susceptibility of [HCN3S2]6[[1]]1,1 were not apparent in the magnetic study of [1,4-(S2N2C)C6H4(CN3S2)][1] However, two phase transitions were observed by X-ray diffraction and conductivity studies.9 It is therefore possible that the points of inflection seen in the magnetic susceptibility of [HCN3S2]6[[1]]1,1 also correspond to transition(s) between metal and charge density wave (CDW) insulator \nThe volatility and air sensitivity of [HCN3S2]6[[1]]1,1 have provided a major barrier to a complete single-crystal conductivity measurement Wires were attached to a number of samples in a He-filled drybox, but the contact and sample degradation were sufficiently rapid to preclude variable-temperature studies Two samples were measured in a drybox, by using gold paint to attach the leads, and in each case the conductivity was found to be 15 S cm-1 \n## Summary\n\nIn addition to the tetrathiafulvalene-based donors already noted,2 many other closed-shell molecules, e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons and amines, form conductive charge-transfer compounds with iodine.14,18,19 In many of these complexes, the crystal structures exhibit linear arrays of disordered iodines, in the form of a complex polyiodide, encapsulated in a channel-like cavity within the host molecular lattice The present system, however, represents only the second example of a highly conductive material to be generated by the p-type doping of a neutral radical It is, moreover, a rare example of a molecular conductor which, like C60, retains its basic structure during the doping process (the dopant fills a structural void) In the present case the combination of stoichiometry, cell repeat distance, and Raman spectroscopic data for [HCN3S2]6[[1]]1, collectively indicate the presence of a polyiodide in the columnar cavity Although we cannot fix the degree of charge transfer with any exactitude, the stoichiometry of the material requires that the oxidation state of each HCN3S2 ring in the doped compound be less than +0.18.20\n\nThe sensitivity of the present compound to oxygen and moisture has precluded a detailed analysis of its low-temperature structure and transport properties From the similarity of the magnetic behavior of [HCN3S2]6[[1]]1,1 and [1,4-(S2N2C)C6H4(CN3S2)]-[1],9 we are nonetheless able to conclude that in the former, as in the latter, a CDW-driven instability sets in below 2K Most importantly, however, the observation of a uniformly spaced structure and high conductivity for [HCN3S2]6[[1]]1,1 confirms that a small degree of p-type doping of neutral dithiadiaxyls away from their neutral oxidation state (a half-filled energy band) can generate a room-temperature molecular conductor \nStarting Materials and General Procedures iodine was obtained commercially (Fisher) and used as received 1,2,3,5-Dithiazolyl was prepared as described previously.10 Sublimitations and gas-phase reactions were performed in an ATS Series 3210 three-zone tube furnace, linked to a Series 1400 temperature-control system Elemental analyses were performed by MHV Laboratories, Phoenix, AZ \n## Triclinic Phase of [HCN3S2] \nSublimation of either the triclinic phase of 2 described here or the monoclinic phase reported earlier affords vapors of the radical 1 In crystal growth experiments the phase of the starting dimer was thus immaterial Crystals of the triclinic phase were typically (but not exclusively) obtained by sublimation of the crude dimer (prepared as described previously) in a put sublimer immersed in a warm (30-35 degC) water bath and evacuated to a static vacuum of about 10-7 Torr The sublimate was collected on an ice/water-cooled finger over a period of 24 h In contrast to the crystals of the monoclinic phase, which are well-faceted, the thin, black needles of the triclinic phase are fibrous and prone to splitting Cleaving the crystals, for mounting purposes, was therefore difficult \n### Iodine-Doped Hexagonal Phase \nCrystals of either phase of dimer 2 (usually about 0.5 g), along with iodine (in a ratio of HCN3S2C1 of 5:1), were sealed at 10-3 Torr in a 25 x 250 mm Pyrex tube which was placed in a tube furnace ramped from 70 to 30 degC",

        "summary": "**Iteration 6:**\nRevised Summary: The material undergoes a sublimation cycle in glass tubes, with the reagents vaporizing and condensing. It forms long, silver-black rods with well-faceted, hexagonal faces. The crystals are air- and heat-sensitive but can be handled briefly in dry air for X-ray mounting. X-ray crystallography and elemental analyses establish the elemental composition. X-ray measurements use monochromated M6 Ka radiation and are conducted on an ENRAF-Nonics CAD-4 diffractometer. The crystals are sealed in epoxy and glass tubes during data collection. The crystal structures are solved using direct methods/SHELX and refined by full-matrix least squares. The triclinic and monoclinic phases of the crystals exhibit twinning. Crystallographic data, including structural parameters, occupancy factors, and isotropic displacement parameters, are collected and analyzed. Nitrogen atoms and N2 molecules are present in the material, with the inclusion of these atoms improving the refinement. The iodine fragments in the material are refined with isotropic displacement parameters and occupancy factors. The high final R-value is attributed to twinning and the inability to accurately model the disorder of the iodine channel. Magnetic susceptibility is studied as a function of temperature. The reproducibility of the iodine content is investigated, and the presence of dimer units and radical units is confirmed. The crystal growth process is influenced by homogeneity and doping.",
