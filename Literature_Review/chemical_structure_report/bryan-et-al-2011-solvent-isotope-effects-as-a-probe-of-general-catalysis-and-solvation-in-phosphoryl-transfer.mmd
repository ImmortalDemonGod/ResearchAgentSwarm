# Abstract

Phosphoryl transfer to methanol from tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN), methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PMNN), and dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate (PMMN) exhibits general base catalysis by acetate ion but no detectable catalysis by acetic acid. For PNNN, acetate catalysis produces normal solvent isotope effects _k_Bogyl/_k_BOD of 1.68 +- 0.01 at high ionic strength (0.475) and 1.77 +- 0.04 at low ionic strength (0.048). A linear proton inventory indicates most simply that the isotope effect arises from a one-proton catalytic bridge in the transition state, although this model cannot strongly be distinguished from a generalized solvation effect. Reactions of methoxide ions produce slight inverse isotope effects _k_Bogyl/_k_BOM of 1.1-1.2, far smaller than the inverse effect of about 2.5 expected for complete and uncompensated desolvation of the reactant-state methoxide ion. The transition state is thus stabilized by substantial interaction with the solvent. The proton inventory for the least reactive substrate PMMN (relative rate constant 1) is suggestive of transition-state stabilization by a combination of one-proton catalytic bridge(s) and distributed sites, while the proton inventory for the most reactive substrate PNNN (relative rate constant 1388) suggests only generalized transition-state solvation (many distributed sites); the proton inventory for PMNN, a substrate of intermediate reactivity (relative rate constant 60), suggests an intermediate situation. The data are consistent with a model in which transition states with exterior concentrations of charge favor stabilization of the charge by isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges, while transition states with distributed charge favor stabilization of the charge by many distributed sites.

## Introduction

A vital scientific contribution of Professor Richard Bader was made already in his doctoral research with C. Gardner Swain, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Building upon their panoramic critique of preceding studies in reaction kinetics and mechanism, the chemistry and physics of isotopes, and the spectroscopy and thermodynamics of solutions, Bader, Swain, and Edward R. Thornton produced a deeply detailed and complete theory of isotopic solvent effects and of reaction rates in mixtures of isotopic solvents (1-4). Two of us (K.B.S. and R.L.S.) count ourselves among those "present at the Creation" (or shortly thereafter) and have been profoundly influenced by these and others of Richard Bader's contributions throughout a period now approaching 40 years. It is with a spirit of gratitude that we present this paper describing a current application of isotopic solvent effects to the issue of the _Canadian Journal of Chemistry_ celebrating the scientific contributions of Richard Frederick William Bader.

Displacement at phosphorus at the phosphate level of oxidation is of particular importance in biochemistry, where it dominates bioenergetics, the formation and decomposition of the genetic materials DNA and RNA, the regulation of protein properties accompanying transmembrane signal transduction, and many other vital processes. In mechanistic chemistry, the understanding of the mechanism of the reaction remains a subject of vigorous investigation and debate. A comprehensive background on all aspects of this broad subject may be derived from the magisterial review of Thatcher and Kluger (5).

Solvent isotope effects provide an entry to the examination of two aspects of phosphoryl-transfer mechanistic chemistry: (_i_) the role of general acid-base catalysis (where the catalytic proton bridge may be expected to generate an isotope effect), and (_ii_) the desolvation or solvation of centers that lose or develop solvation sites of sufficient basicity to produce hydrogen-isotope fractionation.

Biochemical phosphoryl transfer reactions are sometimes hydrolytic, as in the dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins, but they often involve transfer from phosphoryl donors to non-water nucleophiles: examples include the formation of 2',3' cyclic phosphoryl derivatives in the cleavage of RNA by ribo-nucleases, the formation of phosphoryl serine and tyrosine residues in regulatory events, and the self-splicing of RNA molecules. In these cases, alcohols reseracts at phosphate centers are occurring either intramoleculary or within catalyst-substrate complexes.

We report here some transition-state structural and energetic features of the phosphate alcohols reactions illustrated in Fig. 1. These reactions bear some relationship to the ribonuclease reaction just described, although the systems studied here are artificially activated by use of _p_-nitrophenyl leaving groups in place of the alkoxy leaving groups present in the natural systems.

## Results

### General-base catalysis of the methanolysis of PNNN and PMNN

The rate of methanolysis of tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN) was examined (as described in the Experimental section) in methanolic acetate buffers as a function of both buffer ratio and total buffer concentration. Figure 2 shows plots of observed rate constants vs. total buffer concentration at five different buffer ratios (the data are given in Table S1 of the supplementary material3). It is not visually obvious but the dependences show a slight upward curvature, probably resulting from a specific salt effect that accompanies replacement of sodium acetate by sodium bromide; thus small negative intercepts with large errors are calculated, as reported in Table S2.3 When the intercepts were constrained to be zero as in Fig. 2, little change in the mean values of the second-order rate constants resulted and the rate constants thus calculated were used subsequently.

alyzed and not general-acid catalyzed. The value of the second-order rate constant for acetate ion general catalysis is (5.54 +- 0.11) x 10-2 M-1 s-1.

A brief examination was made of the buffer catalysis of the methanolysis of dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate (PMMN) by a 1:1 buffer of acetic acid and sodium acetate at total buffer concentrations of 0.5, 0.7, and 0.95 M without added salt (Table S33). Assuming acetate ion to be the sole catalyst, its second-order rate constant is (2.25 +- 0.22) x 10-4 M-1 s-1.

### Solvent isotope effect and proton inventory for the acetate-catalyzed methanolysis of PNNN

The rate constants for general-base catalysis by acetate ion of the methanolysis of PNNN in CH3OH, CH3OD, and binary mixtures of the isotopic solvents were obtained from the observed first-order rate constants in 1:1 buffers of acetic acid and sodium acetate. It was assumed that, as in CH3OH, acetate was the sole catalyst in the deuterated solvents (otherwise an infinite inverse isotope effect for acetic acid catalysis would be required). The first-order rate constants are presented in Table S43 (for an ionic strength of 0.475 maintained by added sodium bromide) and in Table S53 (for an ionic strength of 0.048 maintained by added sodium nitrate). The acetate ion catalytic constants are given in Tables 1 and 2.

Solvent isotope effects and proton inventories for the methoxide ion promoted methanolysis of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN

In Tables S6, S7, and S8 of the supplementary material3 are given first-order rate constants for methoxide ion promoted methanolyses of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN in CH3OH, CH3OD, and binary mixtures of the isotopic solvents. In a manner reminiscent of the behavior in acetate buffers described above, the plots of first-order rate constants against sodium methoxide concentration exhibited a small upward curvature so that when the data were fitted to a straight line, small but definite negative intercepts with large errors were calculated. A reasonable explanation is a specific salt effect resulting from the replacement of bromide ion by methoxide ion. When the intercepts were constrained to be zero, only modest effects on the calculated second-order rate constants resulted. Values obtained in this way were therefore employed in subsequent considerations. The results of these calculations are presented for the reactions of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN, respectively, in Tables 3, 4, and 5.

## Discussion

Transition-state stabilization in general-base catalyzed methanolysis of _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate esters

General base catalysis of these reactions by acetate ion can in principle occur in any of the following catalytic modes:

(_i_) _nucleophilic mode_, in which the acetate ion displaces _p_-nitrophenoxide ion to form a rapidly solvolyzed acetyl phosphate intermediate;

(_ii_) _prolytic mode_, in which a transition state for attack by

Figure 4: Three forms of transition-state stabilization for protolytic general-base catalysis of nucleophilic displacement at phosphatechosphorus. Note that all structures are isomeric and thus kinetically indistinguishable. (_a_) Proton bridging from an attacking nucleophilic ROH to a general base B (class n or “classical general-base” catalysis). (_b_) Proton bridging from the conjugate acid of the general base B to the departing leaving-group ArO” (class e or “specific-base general-acid” catalysis). This is often thought to be probable only if leaving-group departure is occurring in the rate-limiting transition state, as in a concerted displacement reaction. (_c_) Proton bridging from the conjugate acid of the general base B to the P=O oxygen (another form of class e or “specific-base general-acid” catalysis). This is often thought to be probable only if leaving-group departure is not occurring in the rate-limiting transition state, as in formation of a trigonal-bipyramidal adduct.

ing but not participating in the reaction-coordinate motion. The "in flight" proton bridge might be expected to generate larger, and the hydrogen-bonding proton bridge smaller isotope effects (for the question of whether the proton in general acid-base protolytic catalysis need be considered "in flight," see refs. 7-9).

The isotope effects observed in this work for acetate ion catalysis of the methanolysis of PNNN are 1.77 +- 0.04 (low ionic strength) and 1.68 +- 0.01 (high ionic strength). These would generally be regarded as indicative of protolytic catalysis rather than nucleophilic catalysis, although undetectable suggests that they be seen as borderline cases. However, if the isotope effects derive completely from a one-proton protolytic bridge, they should generate a linear _proton inventory_ (10-14), i.e., plot of rate constant vs. mole fraction of deuterium in mixtures of methanol-_h_ and methanol-_d_. If, on the other hand, the isotope effects arise from generalized solvation changes, they should give an exponential proton inventory. This treatment assumes that the relatively weakly basic acetate ion produces negligible isotope fractionation so that the entire solvent isotope effect derives from transition-state sites.

Figure 5 shows the data compared with linear and exponential models. The solid curves describe the linear, protolytic model and are obviously consistent with the data at both ionic strengths. The dotted curves represent unconstrained exponential fits to the data, and are equally consistent with the data at both ionic strengths. Thus, the proton-inventory data do not rigorously distinguish protolytic from nucleophilic catalysis. However, the dash-dot lines provide a suggestive indication that protolytic catalysis may be at work. In these exponential, generalized-solvation models, the rate constants in methanol-_h_ and methanol-_d_ have been constrained to the values from the linear fit, which are closer to the measurements at the low and high limits of deuteration. These models clearly make a poorer fit to the data than the linear models. We therefore conclude that the more probable mode of catalysis is protolytic but that contributions from nucleophilic catalysis or another generalized-solvation model cannot be rigorously excluded. The protolytic catalysis model may apply as well to the observation of Bel'skii et al. (15) that triethanolamine catalysis of the ethanolysis of diphenyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate produces a solvent isotope effect of 2.

The data show that any one-proton bridge that is present is producing an isotope effect no larger than the observed isotope effect of 1.7-1.8: the observed isotope effect is not the resultant of a much larger effect from the proton bridge, partly cancelled by inverse solvent isotope-effect contributions arising from "tightly bound" sites in the solvation sphere of the transition state. An isotope effect from a one-proton catalytic bridge can be as small as 1.7-1.8 in at least two ways: _(a)_ the proton may be "in flight" but very symmetrically disposed between donor and acceptor atoms (16); _(b)_ the proton may be in a stable potential with a structure that generates some isotope fractionation, such as the kind of hydrogen bond observed by Kreevy and Liang (17), a suggestion originally made by Eliason and Kreevy (18) and others (19) and lately revived under the rubric of "low-barrier hydrogen bonds (20)." Our data cannot distinguish these concepts, although we favor the latter hypothesis for reasons earlier presented (9). _We conclude from these data that a major part of the isotope effect of 1.7-1.8 is associated with a one-proton catalytic bridge in the transition state, with possible contributions from generalized solvation changes._

Transition-state stabilization in methoxide ion promoted methanolysis of _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate esters

The simplest view of methoxide ion promoted methanolysis of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN is that methoxide ion is bonding to P in the transition state, with its charge appearing chiefly (_a_) on the oxygen of the P=O group if a hypervalent adduct is forming (such an adduct should expel the ArO leaving group quite rapidly, so formation of the adduct should be the rate-limiting step), or (_b_) on the oxygen of the ArO leaving group (perhaps also on the oxygen of the P=O) if a concerted displacement is occurring. Methanol molecules could be interacting at any of these sites to stabilize the negative charge. On one model, the individual interactions might be quite numerous, weak, and generate only small isotope fractionation at each site; we refer to this model as a "solvation only" model. On the other hand, methoxide ion may be playing the same role in transition-state stabilization that is played by acetate ion in the buffer-catalyzed reaction: there may be transition

The solid circles represent the experimental data from Tables 1 and 2; where error bars are not visible, they lie within the space of the symbol. The data are buffer catalysis constants at fraction of base 0.5. The solid curves are linear and correspond to one-proton catalysis and to linear least-squares best fits of the data (10\({}^{4}\) kg (M\({}^{+}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) = (38 +- 31) = \(1-n\) + (0.565 +- 0.012)) for the upper curve; 10\({}^{4}\) kg (M\({}^{-}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) = (259 +- 3) (1\(-n\) + _n_(0.585 +- 0.002)) for the lower curve). The dotted curves are exponential and are least-squares fits with no constraints (10\({}^{4}\) kg (M\({}^{-}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) = (388 +- 7) (0.579 +- 0.020)\({}^{\prime}\) for the upper curve; 10\({}^{4}\) kg (M\({}^{-}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) = (263 +- 4) (0.597 +- 0.019)\({}^{\prime}\) for the lower curve. The dash-dot curves are exponential representations with the rate constant in methanol-h and the isotope effect constrained to the values obtained in the linear best fit.

state stabilization (at any of the three sites in Fig. 4) by means of a one-proton bridge. We call this model a "proton-bridge plus solvation model," since more diffuse solvation may also be occurring.

Methoxide ion itself is triply solvated by methanol molecules that generate substantial isotope fractionation (21-24). Each site has a deuterium fractionation factor (10-14) of 0.74 (expressing the deuterium preference relative to an average site in the bulk methanol solvent, so that protium is preferred in the three solvating sites by a factor of 1/0.74 = 1.35). Kresge's formulation (25) can be used to express this reactant-state contribution and the transition-state contribution to the partial solvent isotope effect _k__m_/_k_0. Here \(k_{m}\) is the rate constant in a mixed isotopic solvent with mole fraction \(n\) of CH3OD; \(k\)0 is then the rate constant in methanol-_h_ (_n_ = 0). The result is shown in eq. [1] and eq. [2], where TSC means "transition-state contribution" and RSC means "reactant-state contribution."

\[\begin{equation*} \left[ 1 \right] \hfill & k_{k}/k_{0} = \mathrm{TSC/RSC} = \mathrm{TSC/}(1 - n + n[0.74])^{3} \hfill \\ \left[ 2 \right] \hfill & k_{0} (\mathrm{TSC}) = k_{n} (1 - n + n[0.74])^{3} \hfill \\ \end{equation*}\]

A plot of the right-hand side of eq. [2] vs. \(n\) can then be used to explore the number of isotope-fractionating sites and the size of the associated isotope effects in the transition states for the methoxide ion promoted hemodialysis of PNNN, PMNN, and PMMN. Such plots are shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8, respectively.

First it should be noted that the observed isotope effects are only slightly inverse for all three substrates, while complete liberation of the three methanol molecules solvating the reactant-state methoxide ion with no compensating effects in the transition state would have produced an inverse solvent isotope effect of (1/0.74)3 = 2.47. Therefore, in all three cases, the transition state includes one or more strongly isotope-fractionating sites that prefer protium over deuterium.

Two plausible, limiting models may readily be generated for such interactions, as described above. On a "solvation only" model, there could be large numbers of sites each generating a quite small amount of isotope fractionation. This model will generate (10-14) an exponential dependence on \(n\) (eq. [3], where \(k\)1 is the rate constant in CH3OD). On a "proton bridge plus solvation" model, one site could be generating isotope fractionation analogous to that in the acetate-catalysis transition state, while the remaining sites could be numerous and diffuse. This situation corresponds to eq. [4], where we have arbitrarily taken the one-proton bridge to generate an isotope effect of 1.5.

\[\begin{equation*} \left[ 3 \right] \hfill & k_{n} \left[ 1 - n + n(0.74) \right]^{3} = k_{0} (k_{1}/k_{0})^{n} \hfill \\ \left[ 4 \right] \hfill & k_{n} \left[ 1 - n + n(0.74) \right]^{3} = k_{0} \left[ 1 - n + n/(1.5) \right](1.5\;k_{1}/k_{0})^{n} \hfill \\ \end{equation*}\]

In Figs. 6, 7, and 8, the "solvation only" model of eq. [3] is plotted as the solid curve and the "proton bridge plus solvation" model of eq. [4] as a dotted curve. Clearly the data lie very close to the predictions of both models, which are only slightly different, so no reliable distinction is possible. On the other hand, a suggestive trend can be noted by comparing the results in the three figures. For the most reactive substrate PNNN (Fig. 6), the experimental points for the most part lie on or below the curve for "solvation only." For the least reactive substrate, PMMN (Fig. 8), the experimental points lie a good deal closer to the "proton bridge plus solvation" model. For the substrate of intermediate reactivity, PMNN (Fig. 7), the experimental points lie between the curves for the two models.

We interpret these results as consistent with a relationship between _charge concentration_ and _one-proton catalytic bridging_. For the least reactive substrate PMMN, where the negative charge is least stabilized by and least dispersed over the non-reacting phosphorus ligands and is thus most concentrated on the three sites (Fig. 4) at which one-proton catalytic bridging is expected, the data lie closest to a model that includes a one-proton bridge. For the most reactive substrate PNNN, where the non-reacting ligands can most effectively disperse the charge, the data lie closest to a model in which the solvating interactions are distributed over many sites, with little isotope fractionation at any single site. The choice of 1.5 as the value of the isotope effect for the one-proton bridge, although arbitrary, is reasonable. Values greater than 1.5 force the dotted curve toward linearity and a poorer fit to the data; values less than 1.5 force the curve down toward that of the pure solvation model.

For the most reactive substrate PNNN, a comparison can be made between the methoxide ion promoted reaction and the acetate ion catalyzed reaction. The methoxide ion reaction

The solid curve is exponential and corresponds to the least-squares best fit to the data, _k_M = 63(0.463 \(\pm\) 0.006)*. It represents a model in which the entire transition-state contribution to the solvent isotope effect is ascribed to generalized solvation effects. The dotted curve is a plot of the equation, _k_M = 63 (1 − \(n\) + (_n_/1.5))(0.70)*, corresponding to a model that ascribes an isotope effect of 1.5 to a one-proton catalytic bridge analogous to that for acetate catalysis and the remainder of the isotope effect to generalized solvation effects.

obeys a "solvation only" model, suggesting that methoxide ion attacks as a nucleophile rather than serving as a protolytic general-base catalyst for attack of one of its solvating methanol molecules. Acetate ion, on the other hand, we suggest to serve as a protolytic catalyst for attack of one of its solvating methanol molecules rather than to attack directly as a nucleophile. Thus our suggestion holds that between the strong nucleophilic methoxide ion (direct attack, "solvation only") and the weak nucleophile acetate ion (one-proton catalysis of methanol attack), the mechanism changes from nucleophilic catalysis (strong nucleophilic) to protolytic catalysis (weak nucleophilic). This in turn implies that the protolytic mechanism is less sensitive to nucleophilic basicity (smaller Bronsted b) than the nucleophilic mechanism, and that the nucleophile therefore bears a larger part of the overall unit negative charge in the protolytic than in the nucleophilic transition state. While we have no direct evidence on the point, such a situation appears entirely possible.

_We conclude from these data that proton-bridge stabilization of transition states, as in protolytic general acid-base catalysis, tends to be associated with concentrations of charge, probably on the exterior periphery of the transition state, while stabilization through generalized or distributed solvation interactions, relatively numerous and with small isotope fractionation at individual sites, tends to occur in transition states with dispersed charge._

## Experimental section

### Materials

Anhydrous sodium nitrate (Merck), sodium bromide (Fisher Scientific), and sodium acetate (Fisher Scientific) were stored in a vacuum oven for no less than 2 days at 120-150degC before use; glacial acetic acid (Fisher Scientific) was used as obtained. Methanol (Fisher Scientific and MCB Reagents), acetonitrile (MCB Reagents), and dichloromethane were distilled through a 48 cm Vigreux column after storage over 4A molecular sieve for no less than 2 days. Methanol-_d_ (Aldrich Gold Label) was used as obtained. Tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (Sigma; PNNN) was used as obtained.

Methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PMNN) and dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate (PMNN) were prepared according to Hamilton et al. (26). To PNNN in dichloromethane was added 0.1 M methoxide solution, slowly (1 drop in 10 s) with vigorous stirring, as reaction progress was monitored by TLC. When PNNN was no longer observed, the solution was immediately extracted five times with 10% aqueous potassium carbonate solution and stored 24 h over sodium sulfate. PMNN was recrystallized from 5:12 chloroform - carbon tetrachloride solution (mp 140.5-141.5degC (lit. (26) mp 141-143degC)). Methoxide addition 10-fold faster, followed by extraction with water and 1% sodium carbonate, drying, and evaporation of the dichloromethane, produced a yellow oil. PMNN was

### Extinction coefficients

Extinction coefficients were determined in methanol for each component of the reaction mixtures monitored, and in metabolic acetate buffers and sodium methoxide solutions for some materials. The values are given in Table S9 of the supplementary material.3

### Kinetics procedure

The sol vol volyvisic kinetics were determined spectrophotometrically using a personal-computer-interfaced Perkin-Elmer 555 recording spectrophotometer. Temperature was controlled at 25.0degC using a thermostatted cell holder. Buffer or sodium methoxide solutions (950 mL) were thermally equilibrated in a 1.0 cm cuvet for no less than 3 minutes. To initiate reaction, 50 mL of a stock solution of substrate (in acetonitrile) was injected with a pipetter or syringe. The reaction was monitored at 315 nm (acetate buffers) or 388 nm (sodium methoxide solutions), and the data collected by a computer program package developed by the Instrumentation Design Laboratory of the University of Kansas.

### Solutions

Acetate buffers were prepared by dilution of weighed samples of the components with appropriate volumes of methanol. Appropriate volumes of these stock solutions were mixed to prepare buffer solutions of desired acid-base ratio. Volumes of stock solutions of sodium nitrate or sodium bromide were added to maintain the desired ionic strength. Sodium methoxide solutions (about 0.1 M) were prepared by weighing sodium under cyclohexane, then washing the metal with methanol, and dissolving it in degassed absolute methanol (Dry Ice - acetone bath). Solutions were standardized against dried potassium phthalate or against 2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylic acid (cinchopben) in dimethylformamide-benzene with exclusion of moisture and carbon dioxide. Substrate stock solutions were prepared by weight in dried distilled acetonitrile.

### Treatment of data

The generation of _p_-nitrophenol in a solution initially containing only PNNN deviates slightly from an exponential time course because the product PMNN also generates _p_-nitrophenol and PMMN, which in turn generates _p_-nitrophenol. A similar deviation is seen in reactions of PMNN. In principle, the system can be described as a sequence of three irreversible reactions. However, PNNN is around 25 times more reactive than PMNN, which is about 60 times more reactive than PMMN. Thus the absorbance change associated with reactions of PNNN and PMNN can be described as a first-order process with a small zero-order correction (eq. [5]):

\[\left[ {\text{ArOH}} \right\rbrack_{t} = \left[ {\text{R}} \right\rbrack_{0}\left( {1 - \text{e}^{- \mu} + a\text{t}} \right)\]

Here R refers to either PNNN or PMNN, \(k\) is the rate constant for reaction of R, and \(a\) is the rate constant for reaction of the product formed from R (i.e., PMNN or PMMN, respectively). Least-squares fitting of the data to eq. [5] gives good values of \(k\) and values of \(a\) that are not inconsistent with the values obtained from the corresponding first-order reaction but which were not used further.
