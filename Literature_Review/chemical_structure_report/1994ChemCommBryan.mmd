The reaction of oxamidrazone with sulfur dichloride affords 4,4'-bis(1,2,3,5-dithiadiazolium) dichloride, which can be reduced with triphenylantimomy to the corresponding bis(1,2,3,5-dithiadiazolyl) diradical; the solid state structure and transport properties of the dimer [S\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{2}\)CCN\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{12}\) are reported.

The concept of using neutral \(\pi\)-radicals as building blocks in the design of molecular conductors' has catalysed the study of heterocyclic thiagyl radicals, in particular derivatives of the two isomeric dithiadiazolyls **1** and **2**.[2, 3] Recently we have shown that both monofunctional\({}^{14,5}\) and bifunctional\({}^{1}\) 1,2,3,5-radicals can be doped with iodine to form conductive charge transfer salts. As part of the development of these new materials a wide variety of monofunctional derivatives of both isomers have been prepared, as well as several polyfunctional derivatives in which two or more heterocyclic rings are linked by a bridging benzene ring.[7] Bifunctional materials with rings linked through carbon[8] and mercury[9] bridges have also been characterized.

As key structural units the back-to-back radicals **3** and **4** have been synthetic targets for some time. The 1,3,2,4-isomer **3** has been isolated as a black powder,[10] but its structure remains elusive. This may be related to the known tendency of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiazolyls to isomerize to the 1,2,3,5-derivatives both in solution[11] and the solid state.[12] Our initial attempts to apply an oxamid(s/SC) condensation approach to the 1,2,3,5-isomer **4** were unsuccessful, but we have now discovered that oxamidrazone\({}^{1}\) reacts with (excess) SCI\({}_{2}\) in acetonitrile to afford the citation **5** (as its hydrochloride) in 15% yield [eqn. (1)]. The crude detection can be reduced with triphenylantimony to afford the dimer of diradical **4** as a black solid. We have been able to purify **4** by fractional vacuum sublimation at 140 \({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{\textregistered}}}}\)/C\({}^{10}\) - 2 Torr in a gradient tube furnace to give lustrous blue-black needles of the dimer, mp 275-80 \({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{\textregistered}}}}\) (50% yield based on the crude location **5**) - 1 Mass spectrum (70 eV, EI); 208 (84%, M\({}^{+}\)); 162 (97%, [N\(-\) NS]\({}^{+}\)); 144 (11%, [M \(-\) S\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{+}\)); 130 (31%, [M \(-\) NS]\({}^{+}\)); 116 (14%, [M \(-\) N\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{+}\)); 104 (5%, M\({}^{+}\)); 78 (45%, S\({}_{2}\)N\({}^{+}\)); 64 (100%, S\({}_{2}\)\({}^{+}\)); 46 (80%, S\({}_{2}\)N\({}^{+}\)); The ESR signal of 4 (in CH\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\), 73) consists of a quintet, with \(g=2.0110\) and \(a_{m}=0.50\) mT; there is an indication above 273 K of the onset of exchange coupling between the two rings, but this is less extensive than was observed in the 1,4-phenylene-bridged bis(1,2,3,5-dithiadiazolyl).[70]

The crystal structure of **4** has been determined by X-ray diffraction: 1t consists of stacks of centrosymmetric dimers packed in a herring-bone fashion. Fig. 1 illustrates the packing in the \(yz\) plane, while Fig. 2 shows the stacking of dimers parallel to \(x\). The internal features of the heterocyclic rings are normal; the S-S, S-N and S-C bonds are all similar to those found in other dithiadiazolyl dimers.[14] The C-C distance suggests little double bond character; at 1.488 A the separation is only slightly shorter than that expected (1.516 A)[15] for an sp\({}^{2-}\)sp\({}^{2}\) single bond. The mean intradimer S-S distance (3.078 A) and interdimer S\({}^{\cdots}\)-S contact along the stack (3.761 A) are also similar to those seen in related dimers. In the monoclinic phase of [HCN\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)]\({}_{2}\), for example, these distances (average values) are 3.11 and 3.76 A.[14]

Perhaps the most striking feature of the structure is the number and shortness of the lateral interdimer S\(\cdots\)S contacts. Many of these interactions, all of which (d\({}_{1}\)-d\({}_{7}\)) are defined in Figs. 1 and 2, are well within the standard van der Waals separation for two sulfurs;[16] collectively they generate a very densely packed structure. Extended Huckel band calculations confirm a high degree of dispersion in both the valence and conduction bands.

In the solid state the dimer is diamagnetic, with a residual spin density at room temperature of 0.01% on a per molecule basis. The measured diamagnetism is \(-\)90 ppm cmu mol\({}^{-1}\) and the 6-value is \(-\)0.5 K. The material exhibits a conductivity of 10\({}^{-8}\) S cm\({}^{-1}\) along the needle axis. This value will likely be enhanced by iodine doping, as found for other systems.[4, 5, 6]
