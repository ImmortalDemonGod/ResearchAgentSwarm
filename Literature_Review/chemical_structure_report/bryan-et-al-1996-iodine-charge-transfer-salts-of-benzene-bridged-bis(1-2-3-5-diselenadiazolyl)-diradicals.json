The crystal structures reveal 1-dimensional electronic structures and limited interstack contacts. Conductivity measurements indicate weak metallic behavior at room temperature, transitioning to a semiconducting state at around 240 K. The structures and properties are discussed in relation to extended Huckel band structure calculations. The study is conducted by C. D. Bryan, A. W. Cordes, N. A. George, R. C. Haddon, C. D. MacKinnon, R. T. Oakley, T. T. M. Palstra, and A. S. Perel from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas, the Guelph-Waterloo Centre for Graduate Work in Chemistry at the University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, and AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey. The study focuses on the electrocrystallization, solid-state characterization, charge density wave (CDW), semiconducting state, band structure calculations, molecular conductors, neutral radicals, superlattice properties, and the preparation, structures, and transport properties of iodine-doped charge-transfer (CT) salts of the benzene-bridged bis(dithiadiazolyl) diradicals [1,4-S] and [1,3-S] (1 and 2, E = S).
