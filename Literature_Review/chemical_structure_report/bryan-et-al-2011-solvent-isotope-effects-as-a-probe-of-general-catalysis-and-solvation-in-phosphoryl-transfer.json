Bryan, K. Barbara Schowen, and Richard L. Schowen conducted research on solvent isotope effects, general catalysis, and solvation in phosphoryl transfer reactions. They investigated the reactions of methanol with tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PNNN), methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate (PMNN), and dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate (PMMN). Acetate ion exhibited general base catalysis, while acetic acid did not catalyze the reactions. The solvent isotope effects (_k_Bogyl/_k_BOD) for PNNN were 1.68 +- 0.01 at high ionic strength (0.475) and 1.77 +- 0.04 at low ionic strength (0.048), indicating a one-proton catalytic bridge or a generalized solvation effect in the transition state. Reactions of methoxide ions showed slight inverse isotope effects (_k_Bogyl/_k_BOM) of 1.1-1.2, suggesting substantial interaction with the solvent. The proton inventory revealed different stabilization mechanisms for different substrates, with PMMN being stabilized by a combination of one-proton catalytic bridge(s) and distributed sites, PNNN being stabilized by generalized transition-state solvation, and an intermediate situation for PMNN. The data supported a model where transition states with exterior concentrations of charge favored stabilization by isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges. Methylation played a significant role in the reaction, involving distributed charge and solvent interaction. Clinton D. Bryan, K. Barbara Schowen, and Richard L. Schowen are researchers involved in studying methanol and its properties. Methanol undergoes proton inventory, stabilization, and general base catalysis. Proton inventory and isotope effects play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of methanol. Stabilization and charge transport are also important factors to consider in the study of methanol.", "clean_entities": ["Clinton D Bryan", "K Barbara Schowen", "Richard L Schowen", "Solvent isotope effects", "General catalysis", "Solvation", "Phosphoryl transfer", "Methanol", "Tris(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate", "Methyl bis(_p_-nitrophenyl) phosphate", "Dimethyl _p_-nitrophenyl phosphate", "Acetate ion", "Acetic acid", "Ionic strength", "Proton inventory", "Transition state", "Methoxide ions", "Reactivity", "Rate constant", "Isotope-fractionating", "Bridges", "Distributed sites", "Charge", "Stabilization", "General base catalysis", "Solvent isotope effects", "Proton inventory", "Transition-state stabilization", "Reactant-state methoxide ion", "Transition-state solvation", "Exterior concentrations of charge", "Isotope-fractionating one-proton bridges", "Many distributed sites", "Transport of charge and solvation", "Key step towards understanding", "PNNN", "PMNN", "PMMN", "Phosphoryl transfer", "Catalysis", "Solvation", "Isotope effects", "Transition state", "Reactivity", "Stabilization", "Charge transport", "Solvent interaction", "Proton bridging", "Distributed charge", "Methylation"], "dirty_entities": ["Entities:", "", "Keywords:", "", "Phrases:", "", "References:", "", "Abstract Concepts:"], "references": "\n\n- S.
