# Abstract

Cosublimation of 1,3- and 1,4-benzene-bis(1,2,3,5-dithiadiazolyl) and iodine/bromine affords crystals of the mixed valence salts 1,3- and 1,4-[(S2N2C)C6H4(CN2S2)][X] (X = I, Br). The crystal structures of the two iodide salts consist of perfectly superimposed stacks of molecular units with interannular spacing along the stacks of 3.487(3) and 3.415(2) A for the 1,3- and 1,4-derivatives. In both compounds the iodines are disordered along the stacking direction. The 1,3-derivative has a highly one-dimensional structure; there are no short intercolumnar S-S interactions. In the 1,4-derivative, however, lateral S-S contacts of 3.911 A afford some measure of three-dimensionality. The bromide salt of the 1,4-derivative consists of ribbons of alternating 1,4-[(S2N2C)6H4(CN2S2)]\({}^{+}\) units and bromide ions. Within each molecule one heterocyclic ring is closed shell, i.e., a [CN2S2]\({}^{+}\) cation, while the other is a discrete radical. The ribbons are layered in zigzag fashion that maximizes ion pairing and isolates the radical centers. The bromide salt of the 1,3-derivative also forms ribbon-like arrays, but the unit cell repeat consists of four layers of ribbons. Within these layers the [CN2S2] rings are approximately stacked. The four rings within the repeat unit along each stack consists of three rings clustered into a trimeric [CN2S2]\({}^{+}\) cation, while the remaining ring is a discrete [CN2S2]\({}^{+}\) cation. Magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurements on the two iodide salts indicate weakly metallic behavior at room temperature, with a charge density wave (CDW) driven metal-insulator phase transition occurring near 270 and 190 K for the 1,3- and 1,4-derivatives, respectively. For the 1,4-derivative, analysis of the CDW wavevector associated with the transition affords a degree of charge transfer of 1/4 of electron per radical, i.e., an overall formulation of [(S2N2C)C6H4(CN2S2)]\({}^{0.5+}\)[]\({}^{0.5-}\). The bromide salt of the 1,3-derivative is a closed shell insulator, while in the 1,4-bromide the isolated radical centers are antiferromagnetically coupled.

## Introduction

Most molecular conductors rely on charge transfer (CT) to generate carriers. Doping can be either p-type, as in the CT salts of organic donor molecules such as TTF, TMTSF, and BEDT-TTF,2 or n-type, as in the alkali metal salts of C60.3 For several years we have been pursuing a different approach to organic conductivity, one based on the use of neutral _p_-radicals, for which the requirement for a partially filled energy band is inherently fulfilled.4 However, the exactly half-filled energy band associated with such materials is subject, in a one-dimensional packing arrangement, to a charge density wave or Peierls instability, i.e., a tendency for the radicals to dimerize.

We have sought to overcome this distortion and to stabilize the metallic state (uniformly spaced radicals) by applying pressure and by preparing materials in which two- and three-dimensional interactions are enhanced. The molecular building blocks we are currently investigating are derivatives of the dithiadiazol radical **1** and its selenium analogue.5 As we and others6 have noted, the exposed peripheries of rings containing chalcogens (E = S, Se) and nitrogen are ideal for developing secondary (E-E and E-N) interactions to neighboring molecules. We have characterized the structures of a wide range of dimers **2** as a function of the substituent R-group7 and have also pursued polyfunctional8.8 derivatives such as the 1,3- and 1,4-benzene bridged biradicals **3**10 and **4.11 Several small band gap semiconductors based on neutral selenium containing materialshave been characterized, but no truly metallic compound has been realized.

An alternative approach to stabilizing the metallic state, one which can still take advantage of the strong lateral interactions found in the neutral materials, involves p-type doping of the energy band away from the half-filled level associated with the neutral state. Recently, and in an effort to produce conductive states by doping, we reported that the triclinic phase of **1** (R = H) could be cosubilmed with iodine to afford a conductive charge transfer salt of composition [**1**]6[**1**]1,12. The room temperature crystal structure of this material consists of stacks of perfectly superimposed and evenly spaced rings, and the conductivity is 15 S cm-1 along the needle axis. However, the volatility and air-sensitivity of this material precluded detailed transport property measurements.

Doping of the heavier, less air-sensitive benzene-bridged bis-(dithiadioxyl) radicals **3** and **4** with iodine can also be effected by cosubilmation with iodine and, in a preliminary communication, we described the crystal structure and transport properties of the charge transfer salt [**4**]1,13 We have now synthesized the bromide salts [**3**][Br] and [**4**][Br]. Herein we describe the preparation of all these mixed valence salts, i.e., [**3**][X] and [**4**][X] (X = I, Br), as well as their solid state structures and transport properties.

## Results

### Preparation of Mixed Valence Salts.

Our initial approach to doping **3** and **4** with iodine involved sealed (_in vacuo_) tube reactions of equivalent quantities of iodine and diradical (as its dimer).14 The two reagents were heated to about 130 degC for several hours, during which time the iodine color was slowly discharged as the CT salt was formed. Further heating of this crude material along a carefully controlled temperature gradient (180-130 degC for [**3**][I] and 220-160 degC for [**4**][I]) for 5-20

by columns of iodines. The heterocyclic rings are evenly spaced at 3.487(3) and 3.415(2) A, respectively. These distances are longer than the mean close interannual S-S separations of 3.140 and 3.121 A in the neutral compounds [3]2 and [4]2.10,11 In contrast to [4][I], in which the molecule is bisected by three mutually perpendicular mirror planes, the structure of [3][I] lies on a single mirror plane that bisects the benzene ring. As a whole the molecule is far from planar; the plane of the two CN2S2 rings makes a dihedral angle of 14.3deg with that of the benzene ring. This deviation from planarity is partly a result of the "nested spoons" packing arrangement of the molecules in the \(z\) direction. The benzene rings are accordingly forced to twist away from an orientation which would accentuate repulsive CH-HC, CH-N, and CH-S contacts. In both [3][I] and [4][I] the iodine atoms are disordered along the stacking direction. In both structures the disorder was modeled by three fractional iodines, with the dominant site being in the plane of the two adjacent heterocyclic rings. This "head-on" mode of coordination of a halide to the two sulfurs of a dithiadazolium cation has been observed elsewhere16,17 and is found exclusively in the bromide salts described below.

In contrast to the four-fold pinwheel patterns found in the solid state structure of [3]2, the "nested spoons" packing motif of [3][I] leads to an extremely one-dimensional electronic structure; there are no short interstack S-S contacts that would foster the development of a more two- or three-dimensional electronic structure. For example, the closest intercolumnar contact is the head-to-head S2-S2' distance which, at 4.300(10) A, is well outside the standard van der Waals contact18 for two sulfurs (3.60 A). The closest contact in the \(z\) direction, S1-S2' (4.530(15) A), is even longer. The S1-N2' distance (3.558(20) A) is also well outside the sum (3.35 A) of the van der Waals radii for S and N. The dovetailed packing observed in [4][I] affords better lateral approaches, and both S-S' (3.911(1) A) and S-N' (3.320(2) A) are significantly closer than in [3][I], although still not as close as seen in the neutral dimer [4]2.

The degree of charge transfer in the two structures can be assessed in a qualitative way by comparison of the internal structural parameters, notably the S-S and S-N bond lengths, with those found in related compounds. As has been discussed elsewhere,19-21 the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of dithiadazolyl radicals is antibonding with respect to both the S-S and S-N linkages. Accordingly, these bonds undergo a slight but predictable contraction as the oxidation state of the CN2S2 ring changes from zero to +1. In both [3][I] and [4][I] the observed S-S and S-N distances are intermediate between those found in fully oxidized materials, e.g., [4][SbF6]2, and the neutral dimers [3]2 and [4]2. Overall the balance slightly favors the latter and suggests an oxidation state of <+0.5 for each ring.

**Crystal Structure of [1][Br].** Crystals of [1][Br] (R = H) belong to the monoclinic space group \(P\)2/_a_, with \(Z\) = 4; a summary of pertinent intra- and intermolecular distances is provided in Table 2. The structure consists of antiparallel ribbons of bromide anions and [HCN2S2]+ cations (see Figure 3). As expected, the intramolecular bond lengths are all typical

for the +1 oxidation state of the HCN2S2 heterocyclic.\({}^{19,21}\) Ion pairing forces hold the bromide ions in a tight pocket, with one cation ring bound "head-on" (_via_ S1\(-\)Br and S2\(-\)Br interactions) and two others situated above and below the bromide (the S1/S2\(-\)Br/Br\({}^{\prime}\) and S1/S2\({}^{\prime}-\)Br\({}^{\prime}\) contacts) (see Table 2 and Figure 3). The remaining coordination site on bromine is taken up by a weak H\(-\)Br interaction (2.797(1) A). At 4.203(2) A (Br\(-\)Br\({}^{\prime}\)) and 4.537(1) A (Br\({}^{\prime}-\)Br\({}^{\prime}\)) the bromide ion separations are outside the sum of the ionic radii (for six-coordinate bromide \(r\)(Br\({}^{-}\)) = 1.82 A).\({}^{22}\)

**Crystal Structure of Mixed Valent Bromides.** Crystals of [4][Br] belong to the monoclinic space group \(C\)2/_c_; a summary of pertinent intra- and intermolecular distances is provided in Table 2. The crystal structure consists of ribbon-like arrays of alternating [4]\({}^{+}\) radical cations and bromide anions strung together along two-fold axes running parallel to the \(y\) direction; these ribbons form in-register layers in the _xy_ plane, as shown in Figure 4. The ribbons are layered in the \(z\) direction, each layer being offset from the one above and below so that the halide ion of one layer is approximately aligned with the internal S\(-\)S bond of one of the CN2S2 rings in the layers above and below it. This packing arrangement, which is similar to that described above for [1][Br], affords a zigzag stacking of bromides ions in the \(z\) direction, with a Br\(-\)Br separation (4.487(1) A) intermediate between the two values noted above for [1][Br]. The coordination shell for each bromide ion consists of four "head-on" CN2S2 rings (Figure 5). Two of these are in-plane (contacts S1/S2\(-\)Br) and two are out-of-plane contacts (S1/S2\({}^{\prime}-\)Br). The inequivalence in the latter two distances arises from the slight rotation of the molecules about the two-fold symmetry axis. The differences in the S1/S2\(-\)Br contacts, however, reflect the important electronic differences in the two in-plane rings (hereafter termed the S1 and S2 rings). As the internal structural parameters in Table 2 indicate, the S1 ring, which is "sandwiched" between two bromides above and below, displays S\(-\)S and S\(-\)N distances which are consistent with a fully oxidized cation. The S2 ring, by contrast, which takes the coordination site occupied by the Br\(-\)HC contact in [1][Br], has internal S\(-\)S and S\(-\)N distances which indicate a free radical or zero oxidation state. There are no close (inside or near van der Waals') S\(-\)S contacts between these radical rings and those in the ribbons above and below. As illustrated in Figure 4, there are lateral, in-register contacts (S1\(-\)S2) between radical and cationic rings in adjacent ribbons; there are also out-of-register contacts (S2\(-\)S2) between adjacent neutral rings.

Crystals of [3][Br] belong to the monoclinic space group \(P\)2/_c_; a summary of pertinent intra- and intermolecular distances is provided in Table 2. There are two radical cation molecules (and two Br\({}^{-}\) ions) in the asymmetric unit, with \(Z\) = 4. The structure consists of "S-shaped" ribbons composed of alternating molecules of [3]\({}^{+}\) and bromide ions; this unit snakes its way across the unit cell in the \(z\) direction (Figure 6). The layering of these ribbons is more complex than in the [4][Br] structure. When viewed down the \(x\) direction, the layered ribbons take on a corrugated, pseudo-stacked appearance (Figure 6). The spacing of the ribbons, however, is by no means uniform, indeed the repeat distance along the \(y\) direction consists of four layers, as expected from the degree of bandfilling (_vide infra_). The layers are built about shallow zigzag stacks of bromide ions. Within these stacks (Figure 7) the Br\({}^{-}-\)Br\({}^{-}\) separations (BrI \(-\) BrI, BrI\(-\)Br\({}^{2}\), Br2\(-\)Br\({}^{2}\), see Table 2) vary widely. The BrI bromides are coordinated to a free-standing cation (the S5/S6 ring). The latter is also coordinated (_via_ the S5\(-\)BrI\({}^{\prime}\) contact) to a bromide below it. The Br2 bromides are more heavily coordinated. Each is encapsulated by four rings, two S7/S8 and one each of S1/S2 and S3/S4 (see Table 2). Collectively the six rings which cluster around the two bromides form two closed-shell triple-dedexer [CN2S2]\({}^{+}\) units reminiscent of those observed in the mixed valence salts [P\(\mathrm{CN}\)2S2]\({}_{3}\)[3]\({}_{5}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{I}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{S}\)\(\mathrm{Idescribed in terms of a pseudo-allyl cation, with two \(\pi^{\bullet}\)-electrons binding the three-ring sequence together.16

**Superlattice Measurements.** Low temperature X-ray diffraction experiments on **[4]**[I] revealed the presence of a superlattice.13 This superlattice, the formation of which is reversible, was discovered by taking scans parallel to the stacking direction [_h,0,0_] at several points in reciprocal space. This approach was based on the assumption that a CDW should have at least one component along the direction of highest conductivity. Scans along [_h,0,6_] revealed small superlattice peaks at \(h\) = +-3/8 and \(h\) = +-6/8 around the [0,0,6] Bragg reflection. The third harmonic at \(h\) = 9/8 was not observed, nor was the Bragg reflection at [_I,0,0_], which is absent because of the body-centered lattice. Similar superlattice peaks were observed around nearly every major Bragg reflection in the (0,\(k\),I) zone but were not observed along [0,0,_I_]. The onset of the superlattice reflections is near 200K, in agreement with the magnetic and conductivity data (_vide infra_), and is interpreted as arising from a charge density wave with **q** = (3/8)**a*, where **a*** is the reciprocal lattice vector. The CDW wavevector is apparently commensurate at \(h\) = 3/8 at all temperatures in the range 10-300 K, but the low q-resolution may have prevented the detection of a region of incommensurability near the phase transition.

**Magnetic Measurements.** Figure 8 shows the magnetic susceptibility behavior of **[3]**[I]** and **[4]**[I] as a function of temperature. As noted previously for **[4]**[I]** the materials are basically diamagnetic insulators at low temperatures. A Curie fit to the data below 100 K leads to susceptibilities of -166 and -149 cgs ppm/mol for the diamagnetic terms for **[3]**[I]** and **[4]**[I], in good agreement with estimates based on the Pascal scheme. The concentrations of unpaired spins are found to be 0.13% and 0.01%, respectively. At increased temperatures paramagnetism develops in both materials. This rise begins near 250 K in the case of **[3]**[I]** and (more sharply) at 200 K for **[4]**[I]**. It is interesting to note that a paramagnetic transition of about the same magnitude also occurs in neutral **[3]\({}_{2}\)** but at a temperature of 450 K. However, this latter transition does not contribute appreciably to the conductivity. Figure 9 shows the magnetic susceptibility behavior of **[4]**[Br]** as a function of temperature. In the high temperature regime the compound shows strong paramagnetism, with a Curie susceptibility corresponding to almost one unpaired spin per molecule; antiferromagnetism, however, develops below room temperature. The compound undergoes a phase transition at 15 K which quenches the magnetism. This magnetic quenching is presumably associated with a dimerization process, as observed in the neutral radicals. However, since the radicals are unable to dimerize in the conventional cofacial manner, other interactions, such as the lateral \(S2\)-\(S2^{\prime}\) contacts noted earlier, must be involved.24 The driving force for dimerization in **[4]**[Br]** would thus be

**Conductivity Measurements.** Single crystal conductivities (along the needle axis) of both [3][I] and [4][I] are shown in Figure 10 as a function of temperature. The results show that the transitions seen in the magnetic measurements correspond to metal-insulator transitions. For both compounds the conductivity is activated in the low temperature region; above 210 K for [4][I] and above 300 K for [3][I] the conductivity is weakly metallic. The highest conductivities attained are 100 S cm\({}^{-1}\) for [4][I] at _ca._ 350 K and 20 S cm\({}^{-1}\) for [3][I] at _ca._ 400 K. The application of about 1 Gpa pressure increased the conductivity of [3][I] and [4][I] by about a factor of 4 but did not appreciably suppress the metal-insulator transitions. The larger size and quality of [4][I] have allowed us to perform variable temperature conductivity measurements along all three principal crystal directions; Figure 11 shows the results of these experiments. In all three directions the same features, as a function of temperature, are observed. The ordering of the conductivities, with \(\sigma_{a}>\sigma_{b}>\sigma_{c}\), is as expected, but the anisotropies (100.25:1) suggest relatively strong lateral interactions.

The bromide salts are poor conductors. Conductivity measurements (Figure 12) confirm [4][Br] as an antiferromagnetic insulator, while the closed shell compound [3][Br] has a pressed pellet conductivity (room temperature) of 10\({}^{-5}\) S cm\({}^{-1}\) (similar to that observed for [5]).[22]

The above results can be compared with the structures and transport properties of charge transfer complexes of other organosulfur compounds with halogens.[25, 26] Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), for example, forms a wide range of salts of formula

[TTF][X]i (X = I, Br, Cl). All the phases, regardless of the nature of X, with 0.7 < \(x\) < 0.8 show a similar stacking arrangement, with separate ordered, incommensurate sublattices for the TTF and halogen columns.27 There are no close lateral intercalumar S-S contacts, and the variations in the stoichiometries depend on the electronegativity and size of the halogen. Integral oxidation states, e.g., [TTF][Br] and [TTF][Cl], are also known, but these consist of arrays of [TTF]2+ dimers and counterions; these salts are not conductive. The stacked salts, which are highly one-dimensional, show activated conductivity at low temperature, with a "flat" conductivity regime above a transition temperature of 230 K for X = I and 180 K for X = Br.28 Tetrathiatetraetracene (TTT) also forms a series of CT salts with halogens, some of which (notably [TTT]2[I3] or [TTT][I]0.75) are highly conductive with a metallic temperature dependence to below 100 K. The structure of [TTT]2[I3] consists of slipped stacks of [TTT]+ cations and chains of disordered triiodide anions running parallel to the \(y\) direction (cell repeat, \(b\) = 3.32(2) A). The TTT molecules are oriented in rows along the \(z\) direction, with close interannular "head-on" contacts (3.373(2) A) between sulfur atoms on neighboring rings. Presumably the latter impart some degree of two-dimensionality to the structure. There are no short S-halogen contacts, as found in the [TTF][X]i materials.29,30

are closed-shell. The simple sinusoidal modulation expected from eq 1 not only opens a gap at the Fermi level but also imposes distortions of the lattice that are in good accord with previous structural precedents. For example, the displacements necessary to make dimers within this array are, as expected, greater than those required to generate the trimer cations. Placed within a chemical context, the interannual S\(-\)S contacts in the dimer units are expected to be slightly smaller than the corresponding S\(-\)S distances in the trimer cations. Such a prediction is entirely in accord with experiment; values of 3.10 A for intradimer S\(-\)S spacings are typical, while the intradimer S\(-\)S spacings in **5** are 3.18 A (mean value). Further analysis of the model allows us to anticipate large separations between monomers and dimers and even larger dimer to trimer separations. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the appearance of a harmonic at **q** = (6/8)**a* may indicate that higher order structural distortions are important in defining the final lattice positions. Clearly, all the clusters are closed-shell units, and the bulk material is likewise diamagnetic. If the same CDW model is applicable to [3][I], the higher onset temperature for the metal-insulator transition presumably originates from the lower dimensionality of this material.

In the bromide salts the presence of discrete, well-ordered bromide ions heralds a formal charge of, on average, +1/2 per CN2S2 per ring. A perfectly superimposed stacked structure, however, is not observed in [4][Br], indeed the ionic radius of Br\({}^{-}\) is too large to allow it. Instead the structure contains one radical ring (0 charge) and one cation (+1 charge) per molecular unit. While the array of radicals is nominally associated with a half-filled energy band, the weakness of the radical-radical interactions (only the lateral S2\(-\)S2\({}^{\prime}\) contacts) is such that an antiferromagnetic structure prevails. The seemingly complex structure of [3][Br], with stacked arrays of triple-decker [CN2S2]\({}^{+}\) cations and [CN2S2]\({}^{+}\) cations, is most easily interpreted in terms of a severe CDW associated with a 1/4-filled energy band (Figure 13).32 Application of the above analysis to such a system, with **q** = (1/4)**a*, reveals a plate distortion pattern completely consistent with the observed structure (Figure 14). The displacements cause three rings to cluster tightly together, i.e., to form a closed-shell [CN2S2]\({}_{3}\)+ cation, while one remains isolated as a discrete [CN2S2]\({}^{+}\) cation. The magnitude of the distortion is such that the resulting material is a rather poor conductor, even at room temperature.

In summary, the susceptibility of stacked dithiadiazolyl CT salts to undergo well defined structural distortions finds a simple explanation in terms of the strong, localized S\(-\)S interannular S\(-\)S interactions known to occur in neutral dimers and trimer cations. Closed-shell structures exhibiting semiconducting or insulating behaviour are thus easily accessible by charge density waves. While the rather high MI transition temperature of 270 K in [3][I] is not unexpected, given the paucity of short lateral S\(-\)S contacts, the high value for \(T_{\rm MI}\) in [4][I] is surprising in the light of the observed anisotropies (100:25:1), which indicate well-developed lateral interactions. By comparison, in TMTSF salts such as (TMTSF)\({}_{\rm C}\)I\({}_{529(m) cm-1. Anal. Cated for CHiN2S2Br: C, 6.49; H, 0.54; N, 15.14; Br, 43.18%. Found: C, 6.39; H, 0.77, N, 15.26; Br, 43.46%.

**Preparation of [3]Br2 and [4][Br].** The dimer of 3 or 4 (0.284 g, 0.500 mmol) was slurried together with an excess of bromine (0.2 is) dry CHiN(10-15 mL). The slurry was heated (with vigorous stirring) at 65 degC for 45 min during which time a bright red precipitate was formed. After cooling the solution to room temperature, the solid was filtered off, washed with CHiCN, and pumped dry for several hours. Excess bromine (trapped as a tribromide) was removed by heating the crude solid at 150 degC under dynamic vacuum for several hours. Yields of the crude dibromides were 95-100%.

**Preparation of [4][Br].** The dimer of 4 (0.284 g, 0.500 mmol) was combined with crude [4][Br]2 (0.364 g, 1.00 mmol) in a sublimation tube (25 mm x 250 mm). The tube was evacuated to 2.0 x 10-3 Torr, sealed, and placed in a furnace at a uniform temperature of 180 degC. After 1 h temperature was increased to 230 degC, and the material was left overnight. The following day the tube was cooled and opened, and the black solid transferred to a new sublimation tube, which was then evacuated and sealed as before. This tube was then placed back in the furnace and the temperature along the tube ramped from 230 to 180 degC. Sublimation (1-2 days) yielded layouts black crystalline blocks. Yields varied between 75 and 150 mg: mp >350 degC; IR spectrum (1600-200 cm-1) 1009 (m), 920 (w), 894 (s), 845 (s), 825 (s), 803 (s), 685 (s), 651 (m), 551 (m), 508 (s). Anal. Cated for CHiN2S2Br: C, 26.38; H, 1.11; N, 15.38; Br, 21.93. Found: C, 26.57; H, 1.26; N, 15.45; Br, 21.71.

**Preparation of [3][Br].** The dimer of 3 (0.284 g, 0.500 mmol) was combined with crude [3][Br]2 (0.364 g, 1 mmol) in a sublimation tube (25 mm x 250 mm). The tube was evacuated to 2.0 x 10-3 Torr, sealed, and placed in a furnace at a uniform temperature of 170 degC. The following day the tube was cooled and opened and the black solid was transferred to a new sublimation tube, which was then evacuated and sealed as before. This tube was replaced into the furnace, and the temperature along the tube ramped from 170 to 130 degC. Sublimation (2-12 days) yielded tavtous black crystalline blocks. Yields varied between 75 and 150 mg: mp 158-165 degC; IR spectrum (1600-200 cm-1) 1352 (m), 1289 (m), 1167 (w), 1115 (w), 973 (m), 881 (w), 828 (m), 795 (m), 723 (m), 690 (m). Anal.

**X-ray Measurements.** All X-ray data were collected on an ENRAF-Nomius CAD-4 diffractometer with monochromated Mo Ka (\(\lambda\) = 0.71073 A) radiation. Crystals were mounted on a glass fiber with epoxy or silicone. Data were collected using a 6/2\(\theta\) technique. The structures were solved using direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares which minimized \(\sum\)_w_(D_F_)2. A summary of crystallographic data is provided in Table 3. As with other systems of this type, the crystals of [3][I] readily twin; the data set used for this report is one of three complete data sets collected; at least 10 different crystals were actually mounted on the diffractometer in order to find those with minimal twinning. The extent of twinning of the crystals was also observed on Weissenberg photographs. The relatively high _R_-value for [3][Br] is ascribed to lack of crystal quality (as shown by the high _R_-merge for averaging duplicate reflections) and the paucity of data because of the small crystal size, which precluded anisotropic refinement of the C and N atoms.

**Superlattice Measurements.** Low temperature X-ray diffraction was performed on a single crystal of [4][I] by using a Cu Ka rotating-anode detecting source and a closed-cycle helium refrigerator. A singly-bent pyrolytic graphite monochromator and a flat graphite analyzer were used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize scattering from the cryostat Be windows. This arrangement resulted in a symmetric resolution function with a resolution width of about 0.01 A-1.

**Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements.** The magnetic susceptibilities as a function temperature were measured using a SQUID magnetometer operating at 1 Tesla.

**Conductivity Measurements.** Four-point conductivity measurements along the highly conducting axes were performed with a Keithley 236 unit. Gold pads were first evaporated onto some of the crystals. For low temperature experiments the wires were attached to the pads with gold paint. For high temperature measurements silver paint was used, as it proved more durable at elevated temperatures. Due to the irregularities of the sample the conductivity of [4][Br] was determined with a two-point measurement. Given the low conductivity of this material, the contact resistance may be neglected.
