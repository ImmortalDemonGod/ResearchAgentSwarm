Most molecular conductors rely on charge transfer to create carriers. For example, the ET salts' are hole-doped whereas the \(C_{\alpha}\) salts\({}^{\rm 2}\) are electron-doped. Neutral radical species in which bands are formed by \(\pi\)-orbital overlap would be expected to have half-filled bands and thus to be conducting\({}^{\star}\), but no such metals have yet been reported. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a molecular conductor which combines both of these approaches: energy bands are formed from one-dimensional stacks of neutral \(\pi\)-radicals, and the material is rendered conducting by electron transfer from the conduction band following doping with an acceptor. The radical species is the 1,4-charge-bis(dithiadiazole)) diradical 1,4-([S\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{2}\)C)\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{4}\)(CN\({}_{3}\)S\({}_{2}\)] (2 in Fig. 1), reaction of which widline vapour leads to crystals of [2][]. At low temperatures this compound is essentially a diamagnetic insulator, but above 200 K the conductivity and magnetic susceptibility increase markedly, and at room temperature the conductivity reaches 100 S cm\({}^{-1}\), which is comparable to that shown by conventional molecular charge-transfer salts.

The preparation of synthetic conductors usually involves the oxidation or reduction of a closed-shell molecule to generate a mixed-valence or charge-transfer salt\({}^{\rm 1-2}\). We have been interested in an alternative approach, namely the use of neutral \(\pi\)-radicals, in which the requirement for a partially filled energy band is inherently fulfilled\({}^{\rm 3}\). There are, however, few \(\pi\)-radicals with sufficient stability and flexibility\({}^{\rm 4}\). Initially we examined variants of the phenanely radical\({}^{\rm 7}\), but recent advances in heterocyclic chemistry have provided a variety of potentially useful \(\pi\)-radical building blocks\({}^{\rm 1,1,2}\). One objective has been to generate materials consisting of molecular stacks or columns, and for several choices of the R-group in 1 (Fig. 1, E = S, Se), this packing arrangement has been realized\({}^{\rm 11,13}\). By definition, however, neutral radicals give rise to a half-filled electronic energy band, which in a one-dimensional packing arrangement is prone to a Peierls instability (essentially a dimerization process) driven by charge density waves (CDWs). Because the radicals tend to dimerize, we have attempted to stabilize the metallic state by applying pressure and by preparing materials in which two- and three-dimensional interactions are enhanced. Several small-band-gap semiconductors of this kind (with E = Se) have been characterized\({}^{\rm 11,13,15}\), but no truly metallic compound has yet been realized.

An alternative strategy for stabilizing the metallic state involves doping the energy band away from the half-filling which is characteristic of the neutral state. We have now found that the oxidation of the 1,4-phenylene-bridged bifunctional radical 2 (Fig. 1, red 4) with iodine produces a highly conductive mixed-valence salt of formula [2][][]. The preparation requires heating a mixture of 2 (1.0 mmol and I\({}_{2}\) (0.5 mmol) in a sealed, evacuated (1 mMTorr) pyrex tube (25 \(\times\) 250 mmol). Slow fractional sublimation along a temperature gradient (225 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 160 \({}^{\circ}\)C over 100 nm) affords, after several days, luminous silver black needles with elemental composition C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{4}\)N\({}_{4}\)S\({}_{4}\)I (yield \(\sim\) 70%).

The crystal structure (Fig. 2) consists of columns of uniformly spaced (3.415(2) A) molecules of 2 interspersed by columns of disordered iodutes running along the \(x\)-axis. Perpendicular to the stacking direction the heterocyclic rings lie in dove-tailed arrays running parallel to the \(y\)-axis. Within the CN\({}_{3}\)S\({}_{2}\) rings, the S-S (2.066(1) A) and S-N (1.616(2) A) bonds are between those seen in the neutral dimer of 2 (ref. [14]) and its di-cation [2]\({}^{\rm 2+}\) (ref. [15]), but closer to the former, implying an oxidation state (per ring) of \(<\)0.5.

The magnetic susceptibility of [2][] was determined between 4 K and the decomposition point using the Faraday technique (Fig. 3). At low temperatures there is a small Curie tail due to

defects in the crystal. Above 180 K there is a steep rise in the paramagnetism, which becomes almost linear above room temperature. An electron spin resonance study of crystals of [2][I] showed the same rise in susceptibility, with a large increase in the linewidth from 20 G at 100 K to 130 G at room temperature. The \(g\)-value of 2.013 was about the same as that observed for 2 (ref. [14]).

Single crystals of [2][I] were wired for four-point conductivity measurements along the stacking axis (\(x\)). Gold pads were first evaporated onto the crystals. Wires were attached to the pads with gold or silver paint, for experiments below or above room temperature, respectively. The conductivity (Fig. 4) is activated in the low temperature regime (\(<\) 200 K), and there are two points of inflection between 170 and 201 K; the low-temperature transition shows hysteresis (inset). From 210 K until decomposition the conductivity is weakly metallic. The highest conductivity is attained at \(\sim\) 350 K where \(\sigma\) = 100 S cm\({}^{-1}\). At a pressure of 1.5 GPa the conductivity is increased by a factor of about four, and the low-temperature phase transition is suppressed.

Low-temperature X-ray diffraction was performed on a single crystal of [2][I] using a Cu K\(\alpha\) rotating-anode X-ray source and a closed-cycle helium refrigerator. A singly-bent pyrolytic graphite monochromator and a flat graphite analyser were used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize scattering from the cryostat Be windows. This arrangement results in a symmetric resolution function with a resolution width of \(\sim\)0.01 A\({}^{-1}\). Because of the large mosaic spread in crystals of [2][I], scans in any direction but the radial direction are expected to show additional broadening from the mosaic structure of the crystal.

A search for a low temperature superlattice was undertaken by scanning parallel to [\(\lambda\)00], the chain axis, at various points

A Curie–Weiss fit to the low-temperature data gave a spin concentration of 0.04% on a per-molecule basis and the diamagnetism was found to be \(-\)197 p.p.m. e.m.u. mol\({}^{-1}\). Based on earlier solid-state magnetic susceptibility studies on undoped 2 (ref. [14]) and using Pascal’s constants the measured diamagnetism is consistent with the molecular formula.

in reciprocal space. The results of scanning along [\(\langle 06\rangle\)] are shown in Fig. 5\(a\). Small superlattice peaks marked with arrows can be seen at \(h=\pm\,3\) 8 and \(h=\pm\,6\).8 around the (006) Bragg reflection. The third harmonic at \(h=\,9/8\) was not observed, nor was the Bragg reflection at (106), which is absent because of the body-centred lattice. Similar superlattice peaks were observed around nearly every major Bragg reflection in the (\(\langle 0kI\rangle\) zone, but were not observed around (00/I) Bragg reflections.

The temperature dependence of the (3/8 0 6) and the (6/8 0 6) superlattice reflections are shown in Fig. 5\(b\). The onset transition is near 200 K in agreement with the magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurements and is taken as evidence of the formation of a CDW. The increase of the intensity of the (3/8 0 6) reflection below the phase transition is quite steep, but apparently second order. The increase of the intensity of the second-order superlattice peak below the transition is less steep, as is expected because its intensity should be proportional to the fourth power of the order parameter rather than the second power.

There is an anomalous 'bump' in the intensity of the first-order satellite near 170 K on warming and a gradual decrease of the order parameter below 170 K on cooling. There is some ambiguity in determining the intensity of an X-ray from a scan through a broad, mosaic peak, however similar hysteretic behavior, with a smaller range of hysteresis, is seen in the conductivity. This could be the signature of an additional CDW phase transition, but a superlattice from a second CDW has not been seen. The CDW wavevector is apparently commensurate at \(h=3/8\) at all temperatures in the range 10-300 K, however the low \(q\)-resolution of this experiment may have failed to detect a region of incommensurability near the phase transition.

In a one-dimensional conductor the CDW wavevector gives the band-filling directly[16], and thus we infer three-eighth-full conduction band(s) in [2][1]. In our previous studies of neutral biradicals such as 2, the two dithiadiazolyl rings (1) were uncoupled and the biradicals could be treated as containing independent spin systems. If this argument is extended to [2][1] then every molecule of 2 is involved in two independent conduction bands each of which contains three-quarters of an electron per molecule for a net charge transfer of one-quarter of an electron per dithiadioxyl ring to give [2][1][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98][99][99][100][101][11][12][13][141][15][162][163][164][165][166][167][168][170][171][172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181][182][183][184][185][186][187][188][189][190][191][192][193][194][195][196][197][198][200][201][202][203][204][205][206][207][208][209][200][200][201][200][201][200][202][203][204][205][206][207][208][209][200][201][200][200][200][201][200][200][201][200][200][201][200][20
