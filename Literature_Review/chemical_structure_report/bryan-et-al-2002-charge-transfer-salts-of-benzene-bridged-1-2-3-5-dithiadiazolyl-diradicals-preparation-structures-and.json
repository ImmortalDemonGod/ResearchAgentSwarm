there are no short intercolumnar S-S interactions In the 1,4-derivative, however, lateral S-S contacts of 3.911 A afford some measure of three-dimensionality The bromide salt of the 1,4-derivative consists of ribbons of alternating 1,4-[(S2N2C)6H4(CN2S2)]\\({}^{+}\\) units and bromide ions Within each molecule one heterocyclic ring is closed shell, i.e., a [CN2S2]\\({}^{+}\\) cation, while the other is a discrete radical The ribbons are layered in zigzag fashion that maximizes ion pairing and isolates the radical centers The bromide salt of the 1,3-derivative also forms ribbon-like arrays, but the unit cell repeat consists of four layers of ribbons Within these layers the [CN2S2] rings are approximately stacked The four rings within the repeat unit along each stack consists of three rings clustered into a trimeric [CN2S2]\\({}^{+}\\) cation, while the remaining ring is a discrete [CN2S2]\\({}^{+}\\) cation Magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurements on the two iodide salts indicate weakly metallic behavior at room temperature, with a charge density wave (CDW) driven metal-insulator phase transition occurring near 270 and 190 K for the 1,3- and 1,4-derivatives, respectively For the 1,4-derivative, analysis of the CDW wavevector associated with the transition affords a degree of charge transfer of 1/4 of electron per radical, i.e., an overall formulation of [(S2N2C)C6H4(CN2S2)]\\({}^{0.5+}\\)[]\\({}^{0.5-}\\) The bromide salt of the 1,3-derivative is a closed shell insulator, while in the 1,4-bromide the isolated radical centers are antiferromagnetically coupled \n## Introduction\n\nMost molecular conductors rely on charge transfer (CT) to generate carriers Doping can be either p-type, as in the CT salts of organic donor molecules such as TTF, TMTSF, and BEDT-TTF,2 or n-type, as in the alkali metal salts of C60.3 For several years we have been pursuing a different approach to organic conductivity, one based on the use of neutral _p_-radicals, for which the requirement for a partially filled energy band is inherently fulfilled.4 However, the exactly half-filled energy band associated with such materials is subject, in a one-dimensional packing arrangement, to a charge density wave or Peierls instability, i.e., a tendency for the radicals to dimerize \nWe have sought to overcome this distortion and to stabilize the metallic state (uniformly spaced radicals) by applying pressure and by preparing materials in which two- and three-dimensional interactions are enhanced The molecular building blocks we are currently investigating are derivatives of the dithiadiazol radical **1** and its selenium analogue.5 As we and others6 have noted, the exposed peripheries of rings containing chalcogens (E = S, Se) and nitrogen are ideal for developing secondary (E-E and E-N) interactions to neighboring molecules We have characterized the structures of a wide range of dimers **2** as a function of the substituent R-group7 and have also pursued polyfunctional8.8 derivatives such as the 1,3- and 1,4-benzene bridged biradicals **3**10 and **4.11 Several small band gap semiconductors based on neutral selenium containing materialshave been characterized, but no truly metallic compound has been realized \nAn alternative approach to stabilizing the metallic state, one which can still take advantage of the strong lateral interactions found in the neutral materials, involves p-type doping of the energy band away from the half-filled level associated with the neutral state Recently, and in an effort to produce conductive states by doping, we reported that the triclinic phase of **1** (R = H) could be cosubilmed with iodine to afford a conductive charge transfer salt of composition [**1**]6[**1**]1,12 The room temperature crystal structure of this material consists of stacks of perfectly superimposed and evenly spaced rings, and the conductivity is 15 S cm-1 along the needle axis However, the volatility and air-sensitivity of this material precluded detailed transport property measurements \nDoping of the heavier, less air-sensitive benzene-bridged bis-(dithiadioxyl) radicals **3** and **4** with iodine can also be effected by cosubilmation with iodine and, in a preliminary communication, we described the crystal structure and transport properties of the charge transfer salt [**4**]1,13 We have now synthesized the bromide salts [**3**][Br] and [**4**][Br] Herein we describe the preparation of all these mixed valence salts, i.e., [**3**][X] and [**4**][X] (X = I, Br), as well as their solid state structures and transport properties", "summary": "Summary: Cosublimation of benzene-bridged 1,2,3,5-dithiadiazolyl diradicals with iodine/bromine yields mixed valence salts with one-dimensional and three-dimensional structures. The crystal structures reveal stacked molecular units with interannular spacing. Magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurements indicate weakly metallic behavior at room temperature, with a charge density wave (CDW) driven metal-insulator phase transition occurring near 270 K for the 1,3-derivative and 190 K for the 1,4-derivative. The bromide salt of the 1,3-derivative is a closed shell insulator, while the 1,4-bromide exhibits antiferromagnetic coupling. These salts demonstrate the importance of short intercolumnar S-S interactions in achieving three-dimensionality and the role of ion pairing in the crystal structures. The preparation and crystal structures of the iodide salts are also described, highlighting the highly one-dimensional structure with lateral S-S contacts and the closed shell insulator with isolated radical centers. The transport properties of these salts, including their metallic behavior, metal-insulator phase transition, and charge density wave, are discussed, emphasizing the degree of charge transfer and overall formulation. The importance of doping, energy band, and the Peierls instability in molecular conductors is also addressed.\n\nEntities: benzene-bridged 1,2,3,5-dithiadiazolyl diradicals, mixed valence salts, crystal structures, stacked molecular units, interannular spacing, one-dimensional structure, three-dimensionality, weakly metallic behavior, charge density wave (CDW), metal-insulator phase transition, bromide salt, closed shell insulator, antiferromagnetic coupling, short intercolumnar S-S interactions, ion pairing, preparation, iodide salts, lateral S-S contacts, isolated radical centers, transport properties, degree of charge transfer, overall formulation, doping, energy band, Peierls instability, molecular conductors, charge transfer salts, conductivity, electron transfer, polyfunctional derivatives, band gap semiconductors, air sensitivity, volatility, solid-state structures, electronic properties.", "clean_entities": ["Charge Transfer Salts", "Benzene-Bridged 1", "1", "C D Bryan", "A W Cordes", "R M Fleming", "N A George", "S H Glarum", "R C Haddon", "C D MacKinnon", "R T Oakley", "T T M Palstra", "A S Perel", "Cosublimation", "Mixed valence salts", "Crystal structures", "Iodine/bromine", "Interannular spacing", "Stacking direction", "One-dimensional structure", "Short intercolumnar S-S interactions", "Three-dimensionality", "Ribbons", "Alternating units", "Bromide ions", "Zigzag fashion", "Ion pairing", "Radical centers", "Unit cell repeat", "Stacked rings", "Magnetic susceptibility", "Conductivity measurements", "Weakly metallic behavior", "Charge density wave", "Metal-insulator phase transition", "Charge transfer", "Electron per radical", "Bromide salt", "Antiferromagnetically coupled", "Preparation", "Crystal structures of the two iodide salts", "Disordered along the stacking direction", "Highly one-dimensional structure", "Short intercolumnar S-S interactions", "Lateral S-S contacts of 3.911 A", "Ribbons of alternating units and bromide ions", "Closed shell insulator", "Isolated radical centers", "Weakly metallic behavior at room temperature", "Charge density wave (CDW) driven metal-insulator phase transition", "Degree of charge transfer", "Overall formulation", "Closed shell insulator", "Isolated radical centers", "Antiferromagnetically coupled", "\\({}^{1}\\) Bryan", "\\({}^{6", "\\({}^{1b}\\) Fleming", "\\({}^{1c}\\) George", "\\({}^{1b}\\) Glarum", "\\({}^{6", "\\({}^{1c}\\) MacKinnon", "\\({}^{6", "\\({}^{1b}\\) Palstra", "\\({}^{1b}\\) Perel", "Charge transfer salts", "Crystal structures", "Transport properties", "Metallic behavior", "Metal-insulator phase transition", "Charge density wave", "Conductivity", "Doping", "Energy band", "Peierls instability", "Radical dimerization", "Lateral interactions", "Polyfunctional derivatives", "Band gap semiconductors", "Cosublimation", "Volatility", "Air-sensitivity", "Molecular conductors", "CT salts", "Organic donor molecules", "Alkali metal salts", "Neutral p-radicals", "Energy band", "Charge density wave", "Peierls instability", "Conductive states", "Doping", "Crystal structure", "Transport properties", "Solid state structures"], "dirty_entities": ["Entities:", "2", "3", "5-Dithiadiazolyl Diradicals", "3- and 1", "4-[(S2N2C)C6H4(CN2S2)][X] (X = I", "Br)", "", "Keywords:", "", "Phrases:", "Structures", "and Transport Properties", "", "References:", "C.

distances are longer than the mean close interannual S-S separations of 3.140 and 3.121 A in the neutral compounds [3]2 and [4]2.10,11 In contrast to [4][I], in which the molecule is bisected by three mutually perpendicular mirror planes, the structure of [3][I] lies on a single mirror plane that bisects the benzene ring As a whole the molecule is far from planar; the plane of the two CN2S2 rings makes a dihedral angle of 14.3deg with that of the benzene ring This deviation from planarity is partly a result of the \"nested spoons\" packing arrangement of the molecules in the \\(z\\) direction The benzene rings are accordingly forced to twist away from an orientation which would accentuate repulsive CH-HC, CH-N, and CH-S contacts In both [3][I] and [4][I] the iodine atoms are disordered along the stacking direction In both structures the disorder was modeled by three fractional iodines, with the dominant site being in the plane of the two adjacent heterocyclic rings This \"head-on\" mode of coordination of a halide to the two sulfurs of a dithiadazolium cation has been observed elsewhere16,17 and is found exclusively in the bromide salts described below \nIn contrast to the four-fold pinwheel patterns found in the solid state structure of [3]2, the \"nested spoons\" packing motif of [3][I] leads to an extremely one-dimensional electronic structure; there are no short interstack S-S contacts that would foster the development of a more two- or three-dimensional electronic structure For example, the closest intercolumnar contact is the head-to-head S2-S2' distance which, at 4.300(10) A, is well outside the standard van der Waals contact18 for two sulfurs (3.60 A) The closest contact in the \\(z\\) direction, S1-S2' (4.530(15) A), is even longer The S1-N2' distance (3.558(20) A) is also well outside the sum (3.35 A) of the van der Waals radii for S and N The dovetailed packing observed in [4][I] affords better lateral approaches, and both S-S' (3.911(1) A) and S-N' (3.320(2) A) are significantly closer than in [3][I], although still not as close as seen in the neutral dimer [4]2 \nThe degree of charge transfer in the two structures can be assessed in a qualitative way by comparison of the internal structural parameters, notably the S-S and S-N bond lengths, with those found in related compounds", "summary": "**Iteration 3:**\n\nRevised Summary: Doping with iodine using sealed tube reactions is the initial approach for preparing mixed valence salts. The structures of [3][I] and [4][I] exhibit different packing arrangements and electronic structures. The iodine atoms in both structures are disordered along the stacking direction. The charge transfer in the structures can be assessed by comparing the bond lengths with those in related compounds. The temperature gradient plays a crucial role in the reaction. The research involves Cordes, Haddon, Hicks, Oakley, Palstra, Schneemeyer, Waszczak, Bryan, Perel, Andrews, Douglass, Fleming, Glarum, Marsh, Trucks, Tycko, Warren, Young, Zimmerman, Kennepholl, Mackintosh, Scott, George, Hili, Mayer, and Wei. The compound exhibits a solid-state structure with nested spoons and a one-dimensional electronic structure. The unit cell parameters for [4][I] are a = 3.415(2). The distance between the heterocyclic rings is 3.487(3) A in [3][I] and 3.415(2) A in [4][I]. These distances are longer than the mean close interannual S-S separations in the neutral compounds [3]2 and [4]2. The structure of [3][I] lies on a single mirror plane that bisects the benzene ring. The molecule is far from planar, with the plane of the two CN2S2 rings making a dihedral angle of 14.3deg with that of the benzene ring. The benzene rings twist away from an orientation that would accentuate repulsive CH-HC, CH-N, and CH-S contacts due to the \"nested spoons\" packing arrangement. The iodine atoms in both structures are disordered along the stacking direction. The charge transfer in the structures can be evaluated by comparing the bond lengths with those in related compounds. The temperature gradient is carefully controlled during the reaction. The research involves Cordes, Haddon, Hicks, Oakley, Palstra, Schneemeyer, Waszczak, Bryan, Perel, Andrews, Douglass, Fleming, Glarum, Marsh, Trucks, Tycko, Warren, Young, Zimmerman, Kennepholl, Mackintosh, Scott, George, Hili, Mayer, and Wei. The compound exhibits a solid-state structure with nested spoons and a one-dimensional electronic structure. The unit cell parameters for [4][I] are a = 3.415(2). The \"head-on\" mode of coordination of a halide to the two sulfurs of a dithiadazolium cation is observed in both structures. The packing arrangement in [3][I] leads to an extremely one-dimensional electronic structure, while the dovetailed packing in [4][I] affords better lateral approaches. The compound [4][I] exhibits shorter S-S' (3.911(1) A) and S-N' (3.320(2) A) distances compared to [3][I]. The degree of charge transfer in the structures can be assessed by comparing the internal structural parameters, such as the S-S and S-N bond lengths, with those found in related compounds. The temperature gradient plays a crucial role in the reaction. The research involves Cordes, Haddon, Hicks, Oakley, Palstra, Schneemeyer, Waszczak, Bryan, Perel, Andrews, Douglass, Fleming, Glarum, Marsh, Trucks, Tycko, Warren, Young, Zimmerman, Kennepholl, Mackintosh, Scott, George, Hili, Mayer, and Wei.
