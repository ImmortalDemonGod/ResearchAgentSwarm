# Abstract

The effect of H-bond donation to the thiolate ligand of (_y_S-C,H,F)Fe(CO),SR (**1**) to give H-bond adducts (**1**-**H**O) and eventually protonation to give [(_y_S-C,H,F)Fe(CO)2(HSR)] * (**1**H+) has been investigated experimentally and computationally. The electronic structures of 1(**R = Me**), several derivatives of 1(**R = Me**)-**H**X, and 1(**R = Me**)H+ have been investigated using DFT (density functional theory) computational methods. As previously suggested, these calculations indicate the HOMO of 1 is Fed\(\pi\)-Sp\(\pi\) antibonding and largely sulfur in character. The calculations indicate the electronic structure of **1** is not altered markedly by H-bond donation to the S center, but protonation results in a reorganization of the electronic structure of 1**H+ and a HOMO that is largely metal in character. The reduction of Fe-S distances upon protonation of 1(**R = Ph**) to give 1(**R = Ph**)H+-**BF\({}_{4}^{-}\)**(2.282(2) and 2.258(2) A, respectively), as determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, also indicates diminished Fed\(\pi\)-Sp\(\pi\) antibonding. Using the carbonyl stretching frequencies as a gauge of the donor ability of the thiolate ligand, we conclude that H-bonding has a continuous effect on the donor properties of the thiolate ligand of **1** (i.e., is a function of the _pK_a of the H-bond donor). A discontinuous effect results when the p_K_a of **1** is reached and the complex is protonated. For our study of **1**, the maximal effect of H-bonding is about 30% of protonation. Because the position of acid-base equilibrium depends on the relative basicities of the thiolate ligand and the conjugate base of the H-bond donor (and the relative heats of solvation of the acids and their conjugate bases), a true continuum of effects can be anticipated only for systems that are pK-matched in their given environments. Thus, when the conjugate base of the H-bond donor is a stronger base than the thiolate ligand (as in the present case), H-bond donation has a relatively small effect, but protonation triggers a large, discontinuous effect on the electronic structure of **1**.

## Introduction

The observation of H-bonding to cysteine ligands in metalloproteins1 has fueled speculation that such dipole interaction may play a regulatory role. This has prompted the development of many small molecule models that incorporate intramolecular NH\(\rightarrow\)S hydrogen bonds.2-12 There is a consensus that dipole interactions decrease the donor properties of thiolate ligands,13 and thiolate ligands that are protonated presumably experience a limiting effect.14-18

#### Discontinuum between Thiolate and Thiol

Given the weakened donor properties of thiolate ligands that bear H-bonds, the redox potentials of metals are influenced, and this is of profound significance with respect to redox-active metalloproteins. Most of our understanding of the effects of H-bonding to thiolates has been garnered from electrochemical measurements on the aforementioned model compounds.[3, 18, 19, 20, 21] Because such electrochemical experiments are carried out at high ionic strength, interpretation of the effects of H-bonding are complicated by the composite influence of the medium. This has prompted us to explore the donor properties of dipole-perturbed thiolate ligands using spectroscopic probes.[22] The carbonyl ligand is a sensitive reporter of electronic changes that take place at metal centers. Indeed, carbonyl ligands in metalloproteins and their model compounds have offered considerable insight into the electronic structures of their metal centers.[23] Other studies have employed carbonyl ligands to explore the effect H-bonding to chloride ligands has on their ability to \(\pi\)-stabilize unsaturated metal centers.[24] In the present study, we employ the electron-rich d\({}^{6}\) iron\(-\)thiolate complex **1** as a model for exploring the effects of Fe\(-\)S(R)\({}^{\bullet\bullet}\)H\(-\)X interactions on the donor properties of the thiolate ligand in low-dielectric solvents. Hydrogen-bond donors (**HX**) yield adducts of **1** in solution (**1\({}^{\bullet}\)HX**) that may be observed under equilibrium conditions. Sufficiently acidic compounds protonate **1** to give a thiol complex (**1H\({}^{+}\)**). The effect of H-bond donation and eventual protonation of **1** (as reported by carbonyl stretching frequencies and modeled by density functional theory (DFT) calculation) is reported herein.

Sufficient (NBu4)(PF6) was added to each of the solutions to give [CCl3COOH] + [(NBu4)(PF6)] = 1 M (1.00, 0.95, 0.90, and 0.75 M, respectively).

The conditions that were employed to collect and process the X-ray data are summarized in Table 1. Data for both crystals were collected at -85 degC using a Siemens P4 diffractometer and Mo K\(\alpha\) (l = 0.71075 A) radiation.30 The data were corrected for Lorentziand polarization effects, and empirical absorption corrections based on \(\psi\) scans were applied.31 Both structures were solved by direct methods and refined by least-squares on \(F^{2}\) using all reflections using the SHELXTL (Siemens) system.32 For **1(R = Ph)**-HBF4,** the hydrogen atom bound to S was located in a difference map, and it was refined isotopically. All other hydrogen atoms were included with idealized parameters. Thermal ellipsoid drawings of **1(R = Ph)** and **1(R = Ph)**-HBF4 are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The hydrogen atom H(1) on the S atom of 1(R = Ph)**-HBF4 forms a H-bond with F(1) of the BF4-C4 anion as illustrated in Figure 2.

## Results and Discussion

**Model System.** We will begin by explaining our choice of metal thiolate complex, solvent system, and H-bond donors that were employed in this study. We have previously shown that the organometallic complexes CpFe(CO)2SR (**1**) are highly electron-rich, as evidenced by the high-lying first ionization potentials (IPs) observed in their gas-phase photoelectron spectra and the fact that they readily react with electrophiles such as alkyl halides [33] and electron-deficient alkynes. [34] The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these complexes are Fed\(\pi\)-Sp\(\pi\) antibonding and largely sulfur in character. Free-energy relationships have been observed between the HOMO IPs and the carbonyl stretching frequencies with respect to the rates of Sn2 electrophilic attack on sulfur. [33, 34] Thus, the carbonyl stretching frequencies are direct reporters of the nucleophilicity of the sulfur. In the present study, we concern ourselves with the effects of dipolar H-bonding on the donor properties of the thiolate ligand. Because the addition of H-bond donors (Bronssted acids) to **1** can lead to decomposition of the complex, we employed relatively stable aryl derivative **1**(**R = Ph**) in this study. Alkyl derivatives of **1** tend to be less stable that aryl derivatives. It was desirable to employ nonpolar solvents in our measurements for two reasons. First, **1** is a relatively weak H-bond acceptor, and polar solvents tend to be competitive H-bond acceptors. Second, **1H**+ tends to undergo solvolysis with displacement of the relative weak thiol ligand. Thus, **1** has the added advantage (as an organometallic) of being soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. We initially employed CCl4 as a solvent because it has been extensively used to study H-bonding effects, [35] but we found **1**(**R = Ph**) decomposes (via an apparent chain-radical mechanism) in CCl4 to give the known dimer ([CpFe(CO))2)(2S(2Ph2)]2+. [36] We found no such problem with CH2Cl2. After investigating several classes of H-bond donors, we settled on carboxylic acids because they exhibited the appropriate range of H-bond donor ability and suitable solvent properties. We note from the outset that our discussion of the effects of adding carboxylic acids to CH2Cl2 solutions of **1** is restricted to analyzing trends. Whereas acid/base titrations in water can be treated quantitatively, the polar solutes that we employ have a significant effect on the properties of the solvents themselves. Furthermore, aggregation of polar solute molecules in nonpolar solvents can lead to localized effects. Accordingly, a quantitative analysis of the titration experiments that are described herein is not provided because of the inherent complexity of modeling dipolar reactions in a nonpolar environment.

## Effect of Protonation on the Molecular Structure of 1.

To determine the effect of protonation on the molecular structure of **1** and to later calibrate the molecular orbital calculations, [CpFe(CO)2(HSPh)](BF4) (**1**(**R = Ph**)**-**HBF4**) was synthesized, and its molecular structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Apparently, the crystal structure of **1**(**R = Ph**)**-**HBF4** is the first of an Fe(II)-thiol complex to be reported, although there are several structures of Fe(III)-thiol complexes known, all porphyrin complexes. [37, 38] For the sake of comparison, we also determined the structure of **1**(**R = Ph**). The structure of **1**(**R = Et**) has been reported previously. [39] The structures of **1**(**R = Ph**) and **1**(**R = Ph**)**-**HBF4** are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Thermal ellipsoid drawings of **1**(**R = Ph**) and **1**(**R = Ph**)**-**HBF4** are provided in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Selected metric data for **1**(**R = Ph**) and **1**(**R = Ph**)**-**HBF4** are compared with relevant data from the literature in Table 3.

to 2.258(2) A for **1(R = Ph)**-HBF4** to relief of the four-electron destabilization that results in Fed_p_-Sp_p_T_ antibonding in **1**. This interpretation is also supported by molecular orbital calculations that reproduce the observed trend in bond lengths (vide infra). We note a similar trend has been observed for (t-BuSH)Cr(CO)s versus its deprotonated analogue.40 Other metric data of interest include the position of the H atom bound to the S atom of **1(R = Ph)**-HBF4** which was located in a difference map and refined. The H atom is 1.35(7) A from the S atom and 2.20(8) A from a F atom of the BF4- counterion. The resulting S-H-**-**-**-** single of 147(3) suggests a nearly optimal dipolar interaction.41

**Effect of Protonation on the Spectra of 1.** Addition of 1 equiv of strong acids such as HBF4*OMe2 to solutions of **1(R = Ph)** in nonpolar solvents such as CH2Cl2 results in an immediate change in color from red to yellow, which corresponds to loss of the Fe-S LMCT band in the visible spectrum (cf. Figure 3, top). We have characterized the product of this reaction as the thiol complex [CpFe(CO)2-(HSPH)](BF4) (**1(R = Ph)**-HBF4**).28 There is a corresponding increase in the carbonyl stretching frequencies upon protonation of **1**, which is consistent with a reduction in the donor ability of the thiol ligand with respect to the thiolate (Figure 3, middle). To interpret the experiments that will be described in the next section, it was important to establish whether the presence of **1H**+ influences the spectra of **1**. The addition of less than 1 equiv of HBF4*OMe2 produces a mixture of **1** and **1H**+ (Figure S1). The carbonyl stretching frequencies of **1(R = Ph)** are unperturbed under such conditions, which indicates no association of **1** and **1H**+.

**Effect of H-Bonding on the Spectra of 1.** The addition of relatively weak acids of different effective acidities results in changes in the electronic and vibrational spectra that can be attributed to the equilibria of eq 1. Thus, an increase in the concentration of CCl3COOH results in gradual loss of the Fe-S LMCT band in the electronic spectrum and a shift of the carbonyl vibrational modes to higher frequency. Rather than a discrete species, we intend **1**-**HX** to represent the continuum of change that takes place when the S-H-X H-bond is polarized from X to S. The absence of an isosbestic point at relatively low concentrations of carboxylic acid (before the appearance of **1H**+) and the fact that the bandwidth of the asymmetric carbonyl vibrational mode remains constant while its maximum shifts to higher frequency (Figure 3, bottom) provide evidence for a continuum of change rather than a shift in equilibrium between discrete species **1** and **1**-**HX**. Such a polarization is expected to depend on several factors, including the relative polarities of the SH and XH bonds and the abilities of the medium to stabilize the species involved. Therefore, one might expect the equilibrium to shift to the right with the effective acidity of HX.42 Indeed, for a given set of concentrations, we observe such a relationship experimentally (Table S2).

**Maximum Effect of H-Bonding on the Donor Ability of a Thiolate Ligand.** Although the range of acidities of the H-bond donors that were employed in this study in CH2Cl2 was immense, the acidities of H-bond donors in an aqueous environment are more restricted (by the autoprotolysis of water). We note that amide NH bonds, which are the conventional donors to cysteine ligands in metalloproteins, are considerably less acidic than carboxylic acids.

Figure 3.: Top: changes in the UV–visible spectra of **1(R = Ph)** in CH2Cl2 upon addition of trichloroacetic acid. Note the lack of isosbestic points. The spectrum of **1(R = Ph)**-HBF4** is shown for comparison. Middle: corresponding changes in the IR spectra of the same solutions that were used to collect the UV–vis spectra. Bottom: normalized IR data that illustrate a shift in frequency without significant change in line width.

#### Discontinuum between Thiolate and Thiol

However, acidity is defined not only by the chemical nature of the species but also by its environment. The acidites (and basicities) of particular functional groups are known to vary several orders of magnitude within proteins, which is due in large part to the dielectric environment.[43] For example, the presence of a metal can lower the p_K_s of the sulfhydryl group of cysteine by several p_K_ units.[44] For the present case, evolution from a nonpolar to a polar dielectric environment is simulated by simply varying the concentration of a given H-bond donor (because the H-bond donors are more polar than the solvent itself). Thus, discrete species such as **1**-**HX** are not observed when [HX] is varied. Instead, a continuum of change is observed that reflects the combined influences of H-bond donation to the thiolate ligand and the polarity of the solvent environment (Figure 3). Eventually, the solvent environment becomes sufficiently polar to stabilize the conjugate acids and bases, and ionization occurs (i.e., protonation of the thiolate takes place). Equilibrium mixtures of **1**-**HX** and **1H\({}^{+}\)** (Figure 3, middle) reveal the upper limit of the effect of H-bonding on the donor properties of the thiolate ligand of **1**. Further differentiation of the relative basicities of S and X simply results in proton transfer to the S. The effects of H-bonding are continuous only to the "end point" of acid titration, at which point protonation occurs and a discrete change in the donor properties of the thiolate ligand takes place. Interestingly, the upper limit of the effect of H-bonding does not appear to be sensitive to the nature of X-.

**H-Bonding/Protonation versus Redox Potentials.** It would be useful to understand the relative impact of H-bonding versus protonation on the redox potential of **1**. Unfortunately, **1**+ rapidly dimerizes upon oxidation,[36] and irreversible cyclic voltammograms are obtained. Also, the thiol ligand of **1H\({}^{+}\)** is rapidly displaced by even weakly donating electrolytes. Furthermore, the aforementioned solvent dielectric effects complicate the interpretation. We have previously established a relationship between the first IP and _F_CO of **1**:[33]

\[\text{IP}=2.68F_{\text{CO}}-36.6 \tag{1}\]

Correlation between electrochemical and photoionization data generally yields empirical relationships of the form[45-49]

\[E_{1/2}=(0.6\text{ to }0.8)\text{IP}-(3.5\text{ to }4.5) \tag{2}\]

Using the empirical formula

\[\Delta E_{1/2}=\lambda\Delta F_{\text{CO}}\text{ (i.e., for }1.6\leq\lambda\leq 2.1\] \[\text{and the observed }\Delta F_{\text{CO}}=0.65\text{ mdyn}/\text{\AA}) \tag{3}\]

we predict a shift of the oxidation potential of **1** by 1.0-1.3 V upon protonation. This range may be compared with the 500-700 mV positive shift that has been observed for model Fe[19] and Ni[18] complexes upon protonation. While the absolute values of \(\Delta E_{1/2}\) predicted by eq 3 may not be accurate, we are more concerned here with the relative importance of H-bonding versus protonation. It has been reported that the redox potentials of model NiI-thiolate complexes are shifted by +250 mV in polar solvents that are capable of H-bonding versus nonpolar solvents.[20] Unfortunately, the corresponding effects of protonation are not known for these systems. Furthermore, similar dielectric effects are observed for the redox potentials of molecules that are not expected to be significant H-bond acceptors. Using the value of _F_CO = 16.46 mdyn/\(\text{\AA}\) that is observed for **1**-**TFA**, we estimate a maximal effect of 300 \(\leq\Delta E_{1/2}\leq\) 400 mV for H-bonding to **1**. This corresponds to an effect for H-bonding that is about 30% of that observed upon protonation.

It is noteworthy that the observed interaction between **1** and H-bond donors is not simply a dielectric effect in that (NBu4)(PF6) does not affect _v_co. Furthermore, the corresponding iodide complex is not influenced by acid (Table 4). There is an effect of acid on _v_co of the chloride derivative (consistent with the harder character of Cl- vs \(\Gamma\)-), albeit less significant than the effect on **1** under similar conditions. The series FpX may offer the opportunity to systematically investigate the effect of H-bond donation as a function of X. Although the addition of an "innocent" electrolyte such as (NBu4)(PF6) does not influence its spectra (Table 4), solvatochromism is observed for **1** (Table 5). There is an approximate linear dependence of \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) on the dielectric constant of the solvent (Figure 5). This trend may be attributed to stabilization of the ground state (dipole stabilization of the antibonding HOMO of **1**, Figure 4) or Franck-Condon destabilization of the photoexcited state.[50] However,

It is noteworthy that all rubredoxins (Fe\({}^{\text{III}}\)(cys)_l_) feature a conserved tyrosine with an arene group that is in close proximity to one of the cysteine ligands, and deletion of this residue affects the redox potential of the iron center.51 Thus, specific dipolar solute\(-\)solvent dipolar interactions other than hydrogen bonding are capable of modifying the redox properties of metal centers.

## Conclusion

We conclude that when the conjugate base of the H-bond donor is a stronger base than the thiolate ligand (as in the present case), H-bond donation has a relatively small effect, but protonation results in a large, discontinuous effect on the electronic structure of **1**. Because protonation depends on the relative basicities of the thiolate ligand and the conjugate base of the H-bond donor, a true continuum of effects can be anticipated only for systems that are p_K_-matched.52-54 Such a match should permit low-barrier transformation of a \(\pi\)-donor thiolate ligand55 into a \(\pi\)-acceptor thiol ligand.56,57 We are currently exploring this hypothesis.

Figure 4: Highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of various Brønsted acid adducts of **1(R = Me)** as calculated by the DFT method. Left to right: **1(R = Me)**, **1(R = Me)**-**TFA**, **1(R = Me)**-**HBFd\({}_{4}\)** and **1(R = Me)**H\({}^{+}\)**. Note that the HOMO is largely S in character until the H-bond is polarized toward S, at which time the HOMO becomes largely Fe in character (with concomitant increase in Cp character).

Figure 5: Relationship between the dielectric constant of nonprotic solvents and \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) of the LMCT band of **1(R = Ph)** and **1(R = C\({}_{\text{a}}\)H\({}_{\text{x}}\)-**_p_-**CF\({}_{3}\)**) (\(\bigcirc\) and x, respectively).
