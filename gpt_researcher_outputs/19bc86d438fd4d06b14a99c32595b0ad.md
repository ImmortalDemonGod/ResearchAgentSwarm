# Bibliography Recommendation Report

## Research Question
How can we create or mimic the essential cellular conditions that support mitochondrial functions, such as ATP production, outside of the cellular environment?

## Introduction
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency in biological systems. Understanding and replicating mitochondrial functions outside of the cellular environment is crucial for various applications, including synthetic biology, disease modeling, and therapeutic interventions. This report analyzes several sources that contribute to our understanding of mitochondrial ATP production and the potential for its replication ex vivo.
