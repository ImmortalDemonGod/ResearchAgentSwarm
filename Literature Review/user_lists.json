These layered models can be used to evaluate decisions made at different levels of abstraction during a typical problem-solving process such as engineering design and planning. In our research, the model building process is viewed as a learning activity and inductive machine learning techniques from AI are combined with traditional optimization methods to form our prototype model building system called AIMS (Adaptive and Interactive Modeling System). The layered analysis models built by AIMS offer several distinctive advantages over those traditional analysis models which can only provide evaluations at very detailed stages of decision making. These advantages include: early evaluation to avoid costly iterations, fast execution for interactive applications, more comprehensibility for human inspection, and deep roots in domain physics for higher accuracy. Case study results of building layered models for a process design task of an intermittent cutting process are presented as a demonstration of the potential use of our system.

Thinking is the ability to challenge and eventually develop acquired knowledge to a higher attainment level.The proposed framework models here are intended for developing, stimulating, and engaging students\u2019 complex thinking process skills. This is a higher-order thinking level and consists of four subthinking skills, i.e., problem-solving, critical thinking, creative thinking, and decision-making. Common and supporting thinking skills of these four levels are identified and derived from the literature, and additional sublearning skills are defined as general capacities to perform a set of tasks and further development of students\u2019 higher-order thinking abilities. Furthermore, questions for focusing thinking or learning activities are developed to transform learned knowledge and skills into practical activities.

Accordingly, in this study, we criticize the lack of conceptual engineering to integrate ethical principles and values into the design and application of data-driven endeavours, with a particular examination at health data. We argue how we cannot strive for a robust ethical assessment without a critically causal frameworkMethodsFirstly, we analyse the translational gap and conceptual conflation of the terms: \u2018bias and fairness\u2019 and \u2018transparency and explainability\u2019, highlighting the misleading definitions and uses given to these concepts at a technical and ethical level. The main distinctions presented clarify the moral expectations given to these concepts and criticise the insufficient development of a conceptual analysis that targets them. We suggest that a fundamental part of a solution to reduce this translational gap implies embracing and applying a causal framework. Thus, we show why using causal models and, most importantly, a causal narrative cannot only help to prevent unethical effects, but it can also influence the efficiency of prediction models and their outcomes. Efficiency, in this case, transforms into an ethically laden concept that demands a causal narrative to align with ethical principles. Finally, we go through examples of COVID-19 decision-making that could have benefitted from a causal approach, highlighting the negative consequences of the NHS electronic health records platform and an OpenSAFELY publication in Nature that substantially suffers from the Table 2 Fallacy.DiscussionThis analysis puts into discussion an interdisciplinary approach to increase critical ethical awareness about fairness. Providing robust and reliable frameworks to analyse and present data, especially in sensitive times like a world pandemic, requires trustworthy practices.ConclusionIntegrating ethics into data-driven solutions cannot be limited by the bias-aware fairness formalisations or the naive applications of transparency and explainability. When it comes to the real-world application of models, their effects can harm individuals in society.

Engineering design thinking is \" a complex cognitive process \" often complex, involving multiple levels of interacting components within a system that may be nested within or connected to other systems. Systems thinking is an essential facet of engineering design cognition (Accreditation Although systems thinking has not previously played a prominent role in engineering education research, it is becoming recognized as an important engineering trait (Dym & Little, 2009; Katehi et al., 2009). Due to the nascency of systems thinking research in engineering education, there are few studies that have investigated systems thinking and its impact on engineering design, particularly with K\u201312 students. As a result, how high school students employ systems thinking processes and strategies is not adequately understood or identified. This research examined high school students' systems cognitive issues, processes, and themes while they engaged in a collaborative engineering design challenge. Cognitive issues are mental activities used during a design challenge, while the processes are the ways in which the issues are approached or sequenced (Gero, 1990). Using exploratory triangulation mixed method research, the systems cognitive issues and processes were analyzed through the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) cognitive analysis framework. Additionally, emerging systems thinking themes and phenomena in engineering design were analyzed thematically outside of the FBS framework. Data from the different sources (verbal, video, computer movements, and sketches) were coded, organized, categorized, and synthesized for themes and patterns. Each data analysis technique yielded useful results on their own, but they were also used together to produce a broader understanding of systems thinking. The research was guided by two questions:1. What are the cognitive issues and processes used by high school students when attempting an engineering design challenge analyzed through the FBS framework? 2. Are there emerging qualitative themes and phenomena as they relate to systems thinking in engineering design? If there are themes or phenomena, how can these themes and phenomena be analyzed and interpreted\u2014essentially repeatedly reviewing and analyzing the data sources outside of the FBS framework looking for themes, patterns, and phenomena? Background Engineering design is a process that has no agreed upon definition. Nevertheless, there are multiple K\u201312 programs and curricula that purport to teach engineering design (Katehi et al., 2009). Although the design definitions vary, studies have shown that high school students can engage in engineering Complexity is another ambiguous term, (Davis \u2026", "authors": [{"authorId": "13036045", "name": "M.

The purpose of this study was to document the funds of knowledge of three Latino adolescents as they worked on a community-based engineering design problem. We sought to identify how the adolescents\u2019 values, interests, workplace skills, language skills, experience with household maintenance, and other funds of knowledge were used in ways that enhanced their engineering design thinking. The findings suggest that Hispanic students bring rich funds of knowledge that can be used to augment engineering design thinking and activity. By identifying these categories of funds of knowledge, we hope to move toward the creation of culturally responsive high school engineering instruction that actively seeks to connect Hispanic students\u2019 out-of-school practices to the formal practices of engineering", "authors": [{"authorId": "36672157", "name": "J.

This work seeks to explore the relationship between these two concepts, comparing their historical development, values, applications, and methods.

We offer a valid way for researchers to understand collaborative processes and for educators to create opportunities for collaboration. Additionally, the feedback from the assessment offers students a way to reflect on their CPS skills.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis qualitative study evaluated 52 elementary students\u2019 CPS skills using co-measure, a validated rubric assessing students\u2019 CPS when working in STEAM-related makerspace activities. Students worked in collaborative groups to \u201cmake\u201d artifacts when solving a problem posed by their teacher. They were assessed using co-measure\u2019s four dimensions: peer interactions, positive communication, inquiry rich/multiple paths and transdisciplinary approaches and scored via each dimension\u2019s associated attributes. Student interviews provided their perspectives on CPS.\n\n\nFindings\nA majority of students scored in the acceptable or proficient range in the social dimensions of peer interactions and positive communication. Students scored slightly lower on the cognitive dimensions of inquiry rich/multiple paths and markedly lower on transdisciplinary approaches when collaborating. Findings suggest to increase CPS skills, teachers might develop \u201cmaking\u201d activities fostering greater inquiry and model ways to strategize and verify information, approach the problem drawing on student interest and prior knowledge and collaboratively use tools, materials and methods that mimic the real world when problem-solving.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nMuch of the current research on assessing CPS during making is in the early stages of considering appropriate assessment approaches, especially in schools. To expand this literature the study includes elementary students between the ages of 6-10, the focus is on assessing their collaboration using an observational rubric. The authors use preliminary findings from young children\u2019s perspectives on making to position the future work.\n", "authors": [{"authorId": "1893803", "name": "Danielle Herro"}, {"authorId": "14969434", "name": "Cassie F.
