        "2. **Employing Information Literacy:**\n",
        "   - Utilize skills in identifying, locating, and formulating queries that retrieve relevant and varied information.\n",
        "   - Aim for queries that not only seek direct answers but also explore related concepts and perspectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Considering Naive and Informed Queries:**\n",
        "   - Naive Queries: Create initial queries based on limited knowledge, focusing on broad exploration.\n",
        "   - Informed Queries: Develop more specific queries based on accumulated information and previous searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Counterfactual Queries:**\n",
        "   - Develop queries that challenge assumptions or explore alternative scenarios, aiding in comprehensive information coverage.\n",

        "   - Balance between retrieving a large number of documents (recall) and ensuring the relevance of those documents (precision).\n",

        "7. **Use of Feedback:**\n",

        "Chain of thought is a powerful metacognitive strategy that involves explicitly verbalizing the step-by-step progression of thoughts leading up to a conclusion. By externalizing thinking into sequentially connected intermediary stages, chain of thought facilitates more robust reasoning in several key ways:\n",
        "### 1. Methodical Unpacking of Complex Ideas\n",
        "Chain of thought allows complex conceptual questions to be incrementally broken down into simpler constituent parts. Think of it like unraveling a tangled ball of yarn by patiently tracing one thread at a time. This methodical decomposition enables deeper processing.\n",
        "### 2. Mapping Inferential Logic\n",
        "Articulating each small inference performed illuminates how one idea logically connects to the next across the reasoning workflow. This manifests the cumulative chain of inferences that aggregate into the final conclusion. It provides visibility into the architecture of arguments.\n",
        "### 3. Critiquing Alternative Pathways\n",
        "Explicitly tracing cognitive steps opens room to divert and explore alternative explanatory branches that could derive different conclusions. Pondering other interpretations enables critical evaluation of the validity and soundness of arguments.\n",
        "### 4. Evaluating Assumptions\n",
        "Assumptions made subconsciously often escape scrutiny. Verbalizing the thought flow makes tacit assumptions plain to see, allowing evaluation of their plausibility and examination of potential gaps or flaws in the reasoning.\n",
        "### 5. Diagnosing Errors\n",
        "Granular documentation of the inference trajectory grants diagnosticity for identifying precisely where and how an error may have been introduced.\"\"\""
