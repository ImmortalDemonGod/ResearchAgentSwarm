## Research Question
What genetic modifications could be introduced to mitochondria to enhance their autonomy from nuclear-encoded proteins and functions?

## Introduction
Mitochondria are unique organelles with their own genome, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes for a small number of proteins essential for mitochondrial function. However, the majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, necessitating a tight coordination between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Enhancing mitochondrial autonomy could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial diseases and a better understanding of mitochondrial biology. This report analyzes several scientific sources that contribute to the understanding of potential genetic modifications to mitochondria to enhance their autonomy.
