# Bibliography Recommendation Report

## Research Question
Can we engineer or discover new pathways or mechanisms for mitochondria to sustain energy production independently of the traditional cellular substrates?

## Introduction
Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, are critical for energy production through the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Traditional cellular substrates such as glucose and fatty acids are metabolized to generate reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2), which are then used by the electron transport chain (ETC) to create an electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis. Exploring alternative pathways or mechanisms for mitochondrial energy production could have profound implications for treating metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and conditions where traditional substrate metabolism is impaired.
