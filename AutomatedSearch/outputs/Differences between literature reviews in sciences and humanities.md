# Differences between Literature Reviews in Sciences and Humanities

## Introduction

A literature review is an essential component of academic research papers in both the sciences and humanities. However, there are notable differences in how literature reviews are approached and conducted in these two disciplines. This report aims to explore and analyze the variations between literature reviews in the sciences and humanities, highlighting their distinctive characteristics, purposes, and methodologies.

## Literature Reviews in the Sciences

In the sciences, literature reviews serve several key purposes. They provide a comprehensive overview of existing research and knowledge on a specific topic, identify gaps in current understanding, and establish the rationale for new research. Literature reviews in the sciences often follow a systematic approach, employing rigorous methodologies to ensure the inclusion of relevant studies and minimize bias.

### Focus and Goal

The primary focus of literature reviews in the sciences is to synthesize and evaluate existing research findings. These reviews aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge in a particular field or research area. The goal is to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or limitations in previous studies and propose new research directions or hypotheses.

### Methodology

Literature reviews in the sciences typically follow a systematic and structured approach. Researchers employ specific search strategies to identify relevant studies, often using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, or Web of Science. They apply predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies that meet specific quality standards. The selected studies are then critically appraised and synthesized to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Emphasis on Empirical Studies

In the sciences, literature reviews primarily focus on empirical studies, including experimental research, observational studies, and clinical trials. These reviews critically evaluate the methodology, results, and implications of previous studies to inform future research design and methodology. The emphasis is on evidence-based findings and the scientific validity of the studies included in the review.

### Reporting Standards

To ensure transparency and replicability, literature reviews in the sciences often adhere to established reporting standards. For example, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines provide a framework for conducting and reporting systematic reviews. These guidelines outline the necessary components of a literature review, including the search strategy, study selection process, data extraction, and synthesis methods.

## Literature Reviews in the Humanities

In the humanities, literature reviews serve a different purpose and follow distinct methodologies compared to those in the sciences. While the overarching goal of literature reviews in the humanities is to provide an overview of existing scholarship, the emphasis is on critical analysis, interpretation, and theoretical frameworks.

### Focus and Goal

Literature reviews in the humanities aim to explore and analyze the existing body of knowledge within a specific field or topic. They focus on theoretical frameworks, critical debates, and interpretations of texts, artworks, or cultural phenomena. The goal is to situate the researcher's work within the broader intellectual context, identify key themes or trends, and contribute to ongoing scholarly conversations.

### Methodology

Unlike the systematic approach employed in the sciences, literature reviews in the humanities often adopt a more flexible and interpretive methodology. Researchers engage in close reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources, including books, articles, essays, and artistic works. They critically evaluate the arguments, interpretations, and methodologies employed by previous scholars to develop their own unique perspective.

### Emphasis on Interpretation and Analysis

Literature reviews in the humanities prioritize interpretation, analysis, and critical engagement with the texts or cultural artifacts under review. Researchers explore the historical, social, cultural, and philosophical contexts in which the works were produced. They may draw on various theoretical frameworks, such as poststructuralism, feminism, or postcolonialism, to analyze and interpret the texts from different perspectives.

### Narrative Style and Argumentation

In the humanities, literature reviews often take the form of narrative essays or argumentative pieces. Researchers present their analysis and interpretation of the existing literature in a coherent and persuasive manner. They may highlight the strengths and weaknesses of previous scholarship, challenge established interpretations, or propose alternative perspectives. The narrative style allows for a more subjective and nuanced exploration of the topic.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, literature reviews in the sciences and humanities differ in their focus, methodology, and purpose. While literature reviews in the sciences prioritize empirical evidence, systematic methodologies, and objective analysis, those in the humanities emphasize interpretation, critical engagement, and theoretical frameworks. Understanding these differences is crucial for researchers in both disciplines to conduct effective literature reviews and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields.
