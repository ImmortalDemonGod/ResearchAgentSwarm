# Quantifying the Economic Impact of Decision-Making Biases Influenced by Power

## Introduction

Decision-making biases are inherent in human behavior and can significantly impact economic outcomes. When power dynamics come into play, these biases can be amplified, leading to distorted decision-making processes and potentially negative economic consequences. This report aims to quantify the economic impact of decision-making biases influenced by power by analyzing relevant research findings and data.

## The Power of Bias in Economics Research

A study conducted by Ioannidis, Stanley, and Doucouliagos (2017) investigated the credibility of empirical economics research by examining statistical power and bias in 159 empirical economics literatures. The study found that approximately 90% of the results in half of the research areas were underpowered, with a median statistical power of only 18%. Furthermore, the study revealed that nearly 80% of the reported effects in these literatures were exaggerated, typically by a factor of two, and one-third were inflated by a factor of four or more.

This lack of statistical power and the prevalence of bias in economics research have significant implications for decision-making. Biased research findings can lead policymakers, businesses, and individuals to make suboptimal decisions, resulting in economic inefficiencies and potentially harmful outcomes.

## Cognitive Biases and Decision-Making

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from rationality in decision-making. They can influence individuals' judgments and choices, leading to suboptimal or biased decision outcomes. Several studies have explored the impact of cognitive biases on decision-making, particularly in the context of financial choices.

A study by Ioannidis et al. (2023) examined cognitive biases across multiple countries to assess if patterns of preferences reflect specific environments and if choice patterns are highly similar but barriers impede consistent outcomes. The study aimed to determine if biases consistently emerge and vary between positive deviants and those who remain low-income. The findings suggested that biased decision-making alone does not explain a significant proportion of population-level economic inequality. Instead, economic outcomes are influenced by a combination of behavioral and structural factors.

## Impact of Decision-Making Biases on Economic Inequality

Decision-making biases influenced by power can contribute to economic inequality. When individuals in positions of power exhibit biased decision-making, it can perpetuate existing disparities and hinder upward economic mobility for disadvantaged individuals.

A global sample study by Ioannidis et al. (2023) aimed to address economic inequalities by assessing cognitive biases across multiple countries. The study found that biases alone do not explain a significant proportion of population-level economic inequality. Structural factors, such as barriers and absence of resources or opportunities, play a more critical role in determining outcomes.

## Behavioral Economics and Decision-Making Biases

Behavioral economics explores the intersection of psychology and economics, focusing on how cognitive biases and heuristics influence decision-making. Several studies have examined the role of biases in economic decision-making and their implications for policy.

A study by Eigenauer (2018) highlighted the lack of concern for cognitive biases in the social and political domain. The author emphasized the need to analyze the constellation of psychological biases that hinder behavioral and policy practices addressing sustainability challenges. By understanding and mitigating these biases, policymakers can develop more effective interventions to address economic inequalities and promote sustainable decision-making.

## The Role of Power in Decision-Making Biases

Power dynamics can significantly influence decision-making biases. Individuals in positions of power may be more prone to confirmation bias, where they selectively seek and interpret information that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs or preferences. This bias can lead to suboptimal decision outcomes and hinder economic progress.

A study by Ioannidis et al. (2017) highlighted the prevalence of bias in empirical economics research. The study found that biases were present in approximately 80% of reported effects, often exaggerating the true impact. When individuals in positions of power rely on biased research findings, it can perpetuate economic inefficiencies and hinder effective decision-making.

## Conclusion

Decision-making biases influenced by power can have a significant economic impact. The lack of statistical power and prevalence of bias in empirical economics research can lead to suboptimal decision outcomes and perpetuate economic inequalities. While cognitive biases play a role in decision-making, they do not solely explain population-level economic inequality. Structural factors, such as barriers and absence of resources or opportunities, are critical indicators of outcomes.

To address the economic impact of decision-making biases influenced by power, policymakers and individuals must be aware of their own biases and strive for evidence-based decision-making. By promoting transparency, accountability, and rigorous research practices, it is possible to mitigate the negative economic consequences of biased decision-making.
