# Comparison of Potential Growth in Sedentary vs. Athletic Lifestyles

## Introduction

In recent years, there has been growing concern about the impact of sedentary behavior on health outcomes, particularly among young adults. Sedentary behavior refers to activities that involve sitting or reclining with low energy expenditure, such as watching TV, using electronic devices, or working at a desk for extended periods. On the other hand, an athletic lifestyle involves regular physical activity and exercise, which can have numerous health benefits. This report aims to compare the potential growth in sedentary and athletic lifestyles based on the available evidence.

## Sedentary Behavior and Health Outcomes

Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between sedentary behavior and various health outcomes among young adults. A systematic review of longitudinal studies found moderate evidence for a negative relationship between sedentary behavior and physical fitness [1]. Sedentary behavior was associated with lower levels of physical fitness, which is an important marker of overall health and well-being.

However, the evidence for the relationship between sedentary behavior and other health outcomes, such as adiposity indicators, metabolic syndrome/cardiovascular disease risk factors, cognitive function, and emotional disorders, was insufficient [1]. This suggests that more research is needed to fully understand the impact of sedentary behavior on these health outcomes among young adults.

Furthermore, sedentary behavior has been linked to all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in adults [2]. There is also moderate evidence for an association between sedentary behavior and the incidence rates of ovarian, colon, and endometrial cancers [2]. These findings highlight the potential negative consequences of prolonged sedentary behavior on overall health and longevity.

## Athletic Lifestyle and Health Outcomes

Engaging in regular physical activity and adopting an athletic lifestyle has been associated with numerous health benefits. Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and certain types of cancer [3]. Regular exercise can also improve mental health outcomes, such as reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety [4].

A systematic review of the impact of sports participation on mental health and social outcomes in adults found that participation in sports was associated with higher levels of body satisfaction, self-esteem, and overall life satisfaction [5]. Furthermore, certain types of exercise, such as ball sports and dancing, were related to fewer symptoms of depression in individuals experiencing high stress [5]. These findings suggest that an athletic lifestyle can have positive effects on mental health and well-being.

## Economic Impact of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity

In addition to the health benefits, there is also an economic impact associated with sedentary behavior and physical activity. Sedentary behavior has been shown to carry a heavy economic burden due to increased healthcare costs and productivity losses [6]. On the other hand, increasing physical activity levels can lead to economic benefits.

A study analyzing the economic impact of a more physically active population estimated that by 2025, the global GDP could be between US$138 billion and US$338 billion higher with increased activity compared to current levels [7]. The economic benefits are projected to increase over time, with estimates suggesting that by 2050, the increase could be between US$314 billion and US$760 billion [7]. These findings highlight the potential economic gains associated with promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior.

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, it is clear that sedentary behavior is associated with negative health outcomes, particularly in terms of physical fitness and cardiovascular health. Engaging in regular physical activity and adopting an athletic lifestyle can have numerous health benefits, including improved physical fitness, reduced risk of chronic diseases, and better mental health outcomes.

Furthermore, there is an economic impact associated with sedentary behavior and physical activity. Sedentary behavior carries a heavy economic burden, while increasing physical activity levels can lead to economic benefits.

It is important to note that the evidence presented in this report is based on the available literature and may not capture all aspects of the potential growth in sedentary and athletic lifestyles. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of sedentary behavior and the benefits of an athletic lifestyle.
