# Empirical Studies on the Relationship between Power, Trust, and Leadership Effectiveness

## Introduction

The relationship between power, trust, and leadership effectiveness has been a topic of interest in the field of leadership research. Power and trust are two fundamental elements that play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of leaders. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of empirical studies that have explored the relationship between power, trust, and leadership effectiveness. The report will examine the existing literature, highlight key findings, and discuss the implications of these findings for leadership practice.

## Power and Trust in Leadership

Power can be defined as the ability to influence others and make them act in ways they would not have otherwise acted. Trust, on the other hand, refers to the belief that an individual or entity is reliable, competent, and will act in the best interest of others. Both power and trust are essential components of effective leadership, and their interplay can significantly impact leadership effectiveness.

### Scarcity of Empirical Studies

Despite the importance of power and trust in leadership, empirical studies specifically investigating their relationship and impact on leadership effectiveness are relatively scarce. Several studies have highlighted this scarcity and called for more research in this area (Frontiers in Psychology, 2019; NCBI, 2019). The limited number of empirical studies exploring the relationship between power, trust, and leadership effectiveness indicates a gap in the existing literature.

### Trust as an Essential Factor in Leadership

Numerous leadership researchers have identified trust as a crucial factor in leadership and leader effectiveness (Atwater, 1988; Posner and Kouzes, 1993; Brower et al., 2000; Jung and Avolio, 2000; Bass and Bass, 2008). However, there is still limited understanding of the relationship between specific leader behaviors, trust, and leader effectiveness (Frontiers in Psychology, 2019; NCBI, 2019). Integrating prior research on mindfulness in the workplace and trust, some researchers propose a conceptual framework that suggests mindfulness impacts leader effectiveness through its influence on leader characteristics and behaviors that enable trust-based relationships between leaders and followers (Frontiers in Psychology, 2019).

### Dyadic Relationship and Trust in Leadership

A significant portion of research on trust and leadership focuses on the dyadic relationship between a supervisor and a subordinate, rather than the role of trust in specific leadership models (Frontiers in Psychology, 2019; NCBI, 2019). Dirks and Ferrin (2002) conducted a meta-analysis on trust in leadership and found that the research tends to look at direct leaders, such as supervisors, as the referents of trust. This indicates a need for more research that explores trust in different leadership models and contexts.

### Trust as a Determinant of Cooperation

Empirical studies have shown that trust is a determinant of the amount of cooperation to be expected between subordinates and superiors (Podsakoff et al., 1990). When trust is present, subordinates are more likely to cooperate and engage in positive interactions with their leaders. This finding highlights the importance of trust in fostering effective relationships and collaboration within a leadership context.

## Empowering Leadership and Trust

Empowering leadership is a leadership style that has gained increasing scholarly and practitioner interest in recent years (Lee, Willis, & Tian, 2018). Empowering leaders delegate authority, provide support, and encourage autonomy among their followers. The effectiveness of empowering leadership, particularly its positive side, has been the focus of research (ScienceDirect, 2017).

### Mixed Results on the Effectiveness of Empowering Leadership

Existing research on empowering leadership has yielded mixed and incongruent results regarding its effectiveness (ScienceDirect, 2017). Some studies have questioned the positive theoretical developments of empowering leadership and highlighted the need for a better understanding of its effectiveness (ScienceDirect, 2017). The mixed empirical results suggest that there may be factors influencing the effectiveness of empowering leadership that have not been adequately explored.

### Inconsistency and Paradoxical Aspects of Empowering Leadership

To better understand the potential reasons for the inconsistency in the empirical results regarding the effectiveness of empowering leadership, researchers have reviewed the literature on empowering leadership (ScienceDirect, 2017). The review highlights the inherently paradoxical aspects of empowering leadership and the need to consider non-linear relationships, directionality, and levels-of-analyses in empowering leadership studies (ScienceDirect, 2017). This suggests that the effectiveness of empowering leadership may vary depending on specific factors and contexts.

### The Role of Trust in Transformational Leadership Effects

Research has also examined the mediating role of trust in the effects of transformational leadership (ScienceDirect, 2013). Different types of trust, such as cognitive and affective trust, have been found to play a significant role in mediating the relationship between transformational leadership and its outcomes (ScienceDirect, 2013). This highlights the importance of trust in understanding the effectiveness of different leadership styles.

## Power Dynamics and Trust Development

The dynamics of power and its impact on trust development have also been explored in empirical studies. Changes in an individual's power can influence trust development and perceptions of trustworthiness (Taylor & Francis, 2018). A longitudinal study found that trust increases or decreases as a function of how much power individuals gain or lose over time (Taylor & Francis, 2018). Changes in perceptions of others' trustworthiness mediate the relationship between power change and trust (Taylor & Francis, 2018). These findings emphasize the crucial role of power dynamics in generating trust within teams and organizations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, empirical studies on the relationship between power, trust, and leadership effectiveness are relatively scarce. However, existing research highlights the importance of trust as an essential factor in leadership and leader effectiveness. The limited number of empirical studies specifically investigating the relationship between power, trust, and leadership effectiveness indicates a need for further research in this area. The mixed results on the effectiveness of empowering leadership suggest that there may be factors influencing its effectiveness that have not been adequately explored. The dynamics of power and its impact on trust development also play a crucial role in understanding the relationship between power, trust, and leadership effectiveness. Overall, more empirical research is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between power, trust, and leadership effectiveness.
