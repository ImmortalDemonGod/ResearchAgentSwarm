Data integration methods aim to combine and analyze data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive analysis of a specific research domain. These methods can handle data of different types, formats, and scales and enable researchers to uncover hidden relationships and patterns.

- **Rule-Based Integration**: Rule-based integration methods involve defining rules or logical relationships between different data sources to combine and analyze the data. These rules can be based on domain knowledge, expert opinions, or predefined algorithms. Rule-based integration methods are often used in domains where explicit rules and relationships exist, such as genetics, bioinformatics, and clinical decision support systems [8].

- **Machine Learning-Based Integration**: Machine learning-based integration methods leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships from multiple data sources. These methods can handle large-scale and heterogeneous data and enable researchers to uncover complex relationships and make predictions. Machine learning-based integration methods have been applied in various domains, including genomics, neuroscience, and social sciences, to integrate and analyze diverse data sources [9].

- **Statistical Fusion Methods**: Statistical fusion methods aim to combine data from multiple sources using statistical models and techniques. These methods often involve estimating the reliability and uncertainty of each data source and combining them to obtain a more accurate and robust analysis. Statistical fusion methods have been widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and social sciences to integrate and analyze diverse data sources [10].
