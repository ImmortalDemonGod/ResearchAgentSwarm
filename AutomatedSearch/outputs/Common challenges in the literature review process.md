# Common Challenges in the Literature Review Process

## Introduction

Literature reviews play a crucial role in the research process by providing a comprehensive overview of existing knowledge on a specific topic. They help researchers identify gaps in the literature, establish the context for their own research, and ensure that their work is building upon existing evidence. However, literature reviews are not without their challenges. In this report, we will explore some of the common problems that researchers face during the literature review process and discuss potential solutions to mitigate these challenges.

## 1. Lack of Relevance

One of the primary challenges in conducting a literature review is ensuring that the selected sources are relevant to the research question or topic of interest. Traditional literature reviews may lack relevance due to limited stakeholder engagement, resulting in a review that is of limited practical use to decision-makers [^1^]. This issue is particularly concerning when reviews address key policy and practice questions [^2^].

To address this challenge, stakeholders can be identified, mapped, and contacted for feedback and inclusion without the need for extensive budgets. Best-practice guidelines for stakeholder engagement already exist and can be followed to ensure the relevance of the literature review [^2^].

## 2. Lack of Transparency and Replicability

Another common challenge in literature reviews is the lack of transparency and replicability in the review methods. Replicability is a central tenet of the scientific method, and without it, the review cannot be replicated or validated by other researchers [^3^]. This issue can undermine the credibility and trustworthiness of the literature review.

To overcome this challenge, researchers should carefully design and publish an a priori protocol that outlines the planned methods for searching, screening, data extraction, critical appraisal, and synthesis in detail. By following established protocols and guidelines, researchers can ensure transparency and replicability in their literature reviews [^2^].

## 3. Selection Bias and Lack of Comprehensiveness

Selection bias is a common problem in literature reviews, where the studies included are not representative of the entire evidence base. This can lead to skewed conclusions and a limited understanding of the topic [^4^]. Additionally, a lack of comprehensiveness stemming from an inappropriate search method can result in reviews that do not include all relevant evidence for the research question at hand [^5^].

To address selection bias and ensure comprehensiveness, researchers should carefully plan and trial a critical appraisal tool before starting the review process. Critical appraisal involves assessing the quality and validity of research studies to ensure that only high-quality evidence is included in the review. Researchers should also design a search strategy with the help of an information specialist, use multiple bibliographic databases, and consider including grey literature to capture a broader range of evidence [^5^].

## 4. Inappropriate Synthesis Methods

Inappropriate synthesis methods can also pose challenges in literature reviews. Methods like vote-counting, which tally studies based on their statistical significance, may not provide a comprehensive or accurate representation of the evidence [^6^]. It is important to use formal methods for narrative synthesis to summarize and describe the evidence base accurately.

To overcome this challenge, researchers should select their synthesis method carefully based on the data analyzed. Meta-analysis, thematic synthesis, and meta-interpretation are some of the formal methods that can be used to synthesize the evidence and draw meaningful conclusions [^6^].

## 5. Lack of Consistency and Error Checking

A lack of consistency and error checking can introduce errors and biases into the literature review process. When a single reviewer makes decisions without consensus, it can lead to inconsistencies in the selection and interpretation of studies [^6^]. Collaborative efforts and multiple reviewers can help ensure consistency and shared understanding of the methods.

To address this challenge, it is recommended to have at least two reviewers screen a subset of the evidence base to ensure consistency. Reviewers should conduct decisions separately and then consolidate their findings to minimize errors and biases [^6^].

## Conclusion

Literature reviews are essential components of the research process, but they are not without their challenges. Researchers must navigate issues such as lack of relevance, lack of transparency and replicability, selection bias, inappropriate synthesis methods, and lack of consistency and error checking. However, by following best practices and established guidelines, these challenges can be mitigated.

To ensure the relevance of a literature review, stakeholder engagement is crucial. Researchers should also focus on transparency and replicability by publishing a detailed protocol outlining their methods. To address selection bias and lack of comprehensiveness, careful planning and trial of critical appraisal tools, as well as comprehensive search strategies, are necessary. Finally, appropriate synthesis methods and collaboration among reviewers can help overcome challenges related to inappropriate synthesis and lack of consistency.

By addressing these common challenges, researchers can conduct literature reviews that provide a solid foundation for their own research and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields.
