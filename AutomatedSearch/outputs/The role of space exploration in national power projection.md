These studies have enhanced our understanding of phenomena such as the Van Allen radiation belts, auroras, and the impact of the solar wind on Earth's magnetosphere.

Space exploration has also contributed to the exploration of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and dust within the solar system. Robotic spacecraft missions have provided valuable data on the geology, composition, and atmospheres of these celestial bodies. For example, missions like the Mars rovers have revealed evidence of past water on the Red Planet, while the study of comets has provided insights into the origins of the solar system.

Moreover, space exploration has facilitated research on nonliving and living materials in the unique low-gravity environment of space. Protein crystal growth experiments conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have contributed to drug development for diseases such as cancer, gum disease, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Studies on bone and muscle loss in astronauts have also provided insights into mitigating the effects of osteoporosis on Earth.

## Military Capabilities

Space exploration has become a critical factor in military power projection and has shaped the evolution of military strategies and capabilities. The United States, China, Russia, and other nations have recognized the importance of space in maintaining military superiority and have developed space and counterspace capabilities accordingly.

The United States, through the establishment of the United States Space Force, has emphasized the significance of spacepower as a distinct and vital formulation of military power. The Space Force doctrine acknowledges that spacepower is not solely a military activity but also encompasses diplomatic, informational, and economic aspects. It recognizes the need for effective planning, partnerships, and global norms of behavior to ensure the longevity of human habitation and operation in space.

China and Russia, in particular, have been actively developing space and counterspace capabilities to challenge the United States' position in the space domain. China's space ambitions were influenced by its observations of the U.S. military's performance during the Gulf War and subsequent conflicts. China perceives space as a critical enabler of U.S. precision-strike and military force projection capabilities. It views U.S. missile defense systems and space-enabled conventional precision-strike capabilities as undermining strategic stability. As a result, China is pursuing counterspace systems to neutralize or deny U.S. space-based services, both military and commercial, to offset perceived U.S. military advantages.

Similarly, Russia views space as a critical enabler of U.S. precision-strike and military force projection capabilities. It believes that U.S. dependence on space is its Achilles' heel, which can be exploited to achieve Russian conflict objectives. Russia is pursuing counterspace systems to neutralize or deny U.S. space-based services, both military and commercial, as a means of offsetting perceived U.S. military advantages.

Iran and North Korea are also developing capabilities to counter space-based services such as communications and navigation. Both countries maintain the ability to conduct electronic warfare against adversaries and theoretically could use their missile and space launch vehicle advancements to target orbiting satellites.

## International Influence

Space exploration has become a significant factor in international influence and competition. Nations are positioning themselves as leading space powers and seeking to create new global space norms. The ability to demonstrate advanced space capabilities and achievements enhances a nation's prestige and influence on the global stage.

China and Russia, in particular, have been actively expanding their space exploration initiatives. China's lunar exploration aims to expand its scientific knowledge and prestige. If successful, it is likely to lead to attempts by China to exploit the Moon's natural resources. Russia, on the other hand, has been involved in deep-space exploration and is seeking to broaden its space exploration initiatives. Both countries' space exploration efforts contribute to their scientific knowledge and enhance their international influence.

Furthermore, space capabilities are proliferating across a growing list of nations. Missile warning, geolocation and tracking, target identification, and navigation services are being developed by various countries for their citizens and armed forces. The expansion of remote-sensing satellite constellations reduces countries' ability to conceal sensitive tests, evaluation activities, military exercises, and operations. The commercialization of space is also growing, with companies augmenting or replacing government-provided launch, communications, remote sensing, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance services.
