# Environmental Power in Future Geopolitical Landscapes

## Introduction

The concept of environmental power in future geopolitical landscapes is a topic of increasing importance as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, renewable energy transition, and sustainable development. The role of environmental power refers to a country's ability to influence and shape global environmental policies, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable practices. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the future role of environmental power in geopolitical landscapes, considering factors such as renewable energy, climate change, sustainability, and global cooperation.

## The Geopolitics of Renewable Energy

Renewable energy has emerged as a key driver of change in the global energy landscape. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower has the potential to reshape geopolitical dynamics. According to a review of the literature on the geopolitics of renewable energy, it is evident that renewables have many advantages over fossil fuels for international security and peace. They reduce the risk of large conflicts and offer a decentralized and abundant source of energy. However, the literature also highlights potential security risks and geopolitical tensions related to critical materials and cybersecurity in the renewable energy sector.

The decline of petrostates, countries heavily reliant on oil exports, is another important aspect to consider in the future of environmental power. As the world transitions away from fossil fuels, petrostates may face significant economic and geopolitical challenges. More research is needed to understand how these countries will be affected by the decline of their primary source of revenue and how they can adapt to the changing energy landscape.

## The Role of International Cooperation

International cooperation is crucial in addressing the challenges posed by climate change and promoting sustainable development. However, the effectiveness of global cooperation in tackling climate change has been questioned. The threat of climate change is not as immediate or recognizable as traditional security threats, making it difficult to mobilize collective action. The global reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, highlighted the limitations of global cooperation in the face of a common threat.

Nevertheless, international cooperation remains the linchpin for addressing the climate crisis. It is essential for achieving ambitious emission reductions, promoting green subsidies, enabling technological transfers, enforcing policies, and fostering compliance. By unifying efforts on a global scale, countries can strive for a sustainable and resilient future, mitigating the impacts of climate change and securing the planet for future generations.

## The Geopolitical Implications of the Energy Transformation

The accelerating deployment of renewable energy has set in motion a global energy transformation with far-reaching geopolitical implications. The advent of a new energy age will reshape relations between states and communities, bringing about a "new world" of power, security, energy independence, and prosperity. The precise scope and pace of the energy transformation are difficult to predict, but it is clear that the transition to renewable energy will have profound geopolitical consequences.

The rise of hydrogen as a central focus of decarbonization strategies for harder-to-abate sectors is an example of how the energy landscape can evolve rapidly. Hydrogen, once considered niche in the global energy discourse, is now seen as a potential game-changer. The widespread use of hydrogen could have significant geopolitical implications, as countries compete for access to hydrogen resources and technologies.

## The Role of Great Powers in the International Politics of Climate Change

Great powers play a crucial role in shaping the international politics of climate change. Material power, rooted in economic clout and military strength, gives countries control over natural resources and ecological systems. Social power, on the other hand, is derived from the recognition and responsibilities that come with being a great power. The concept of environmental power extends to the ability of great powers to influence global environmental policies and take on responsibilities for the collective good.

The European Union (EU) has been a consistent leader in the field of environmental power, but its influence may be diminishing as it transitions towards more sustainable forms of economic growth. The EU now finds itself in a position of demanding solutions but with diminishing ability to broker deals in international negotiations. Other great powers, such as the United States and emerging economies like China, also have significant roles to play in shaping the future of environmental power.

## Geopolitics, Equitable Transition, and AI

Geopolitics has always been at the forefront of energy, and the transition to renewable energy is no exception. The geopolitics of renewable energy extend beyond traditional oil and gas dynamics to include critical materials needed for renewable technologies. The control and access to these materials can become sources of geopolitical competition and tension.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is another factor that could impact the future of environmental power. The AI revolution in the energy sector has the potential to transform demand, making energy systems more efficient and enabling a more equitable transition. However, the full extent of AI's impact on the energy sector is yet to be determined.

## Conclusion

The future role of environmental power in geopolitical landscapes is complex and multifaceted. The transition to renewable energy, the decline of petrostates, the need for international cooperation, and the influence of great powers all shape the dynamics of environmental power. While renewable energy offers many advantages for international security and peace, it also presents challenges related to security risks, geopolitical tensions, and the decline of petrostates.

International cooperation remains crucial in addressing the challenges of climate change and promoting sustainable development. However, the effectiveness of global cooperation in tackling climate change is still a subject of debate. The rise of hydrogen and the potential impact of AI on the energy sector further complicate the future of environmental power.

In conclusion, the future of environmental power in geopolitical landscapes will depend on the ability of countries to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition and climate change. International cooperation, technological innovation, and strategic decision-making by great powers will play a crucial role in shaping the future of environmental power.
