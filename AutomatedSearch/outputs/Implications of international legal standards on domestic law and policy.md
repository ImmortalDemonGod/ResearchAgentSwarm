# Implications of International Legal Standards on Domestic Law and Policy

## Introduction

The relationship between international law and domestic legal systems is a complex and dynamic one. International legal standards have significant implications for domestic law and policy, as they can shape and influence the development and implementation of domestic legislation. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the implications of international legal standards on domestic law and policy, drawing on various scholarly sources and empirical studies.

## Integration of International Law into Domestic Legal Systems

International law is integrated into domestic legal systems to varying degrees. According to data from the Comparative Constitutions Project, 92% of national constitutions include provisions pertaining to international law (Elkins et al., 2009). This integration reflects the recognition of the importance of international legal standards in domestic governance and the desire to align domestic laws with international obligations.

States often change domestic laws to comply with international agreements, demonstrating the influence of international law on domestic legislation (Simmons, 2009; Lupu, 2013; Tsutsui, 2018). This process of domestic law reform to align with international standards is driven by the desire to fulfill international obligations and maintain a favorable international reputation. However, the specific treatment of international laws in domestic courts varies across states and legal traditions (Simmons, 2009; Lupu, 2013; Tsutsui, 2018).

## Compliance with International Law and Public Opinion

The compliance of states with international law is not solely determined by legal obligations but also influenced by public opinion. Recent research suggests that public disapproval of governments that violate treaty agreements can serve as a deterrent to non-compliance (Hill Jr, 2010; Fariss, 2014). However, it is important to differentiate between two distinct motivations underlying public disapproval: respect for legal obligations and the desire to follow common global practices (Lupu and Wallace, 2019).

A survey experiment conducted in Japan found that the legal obligation cue had a stronger effect on respondent attitudes towards controversial practices that violate international law compared to the common practices cue (Lupu and Wallace, 2019). This suggests that citizens value compliance with legally binding commitments and expect their governments to abide by international law. The study also revealed subgroup differences based on partisanship and identification with global civil society, highlighting the complexity of public attitudes towards international law (Lupu and Wallace, 2019).

## Incorporation of International Standards in Domestic Litigation

International human rights law can play a significant role in domestic litigation, even in jurisdictions with limited formal recognition of international standards (Guide to International Law, 2022). The most effective approach is when the constitution directly incorporates duly ratified treaties and places them above statutory law in the domestic legal system (Guide to International Law, 2022). However, even in the absence of such explicit recognition, international standards can inform the interpretation of domestic laws by courts (Guide to International Law, 2022).

Courts and tribunals may be open to non-binding 'soft-law' statements or decisions interpreting a treaty to which the state is not a party, as these can provide persuasive arguments for interpreting domestic law (Guide to International Law, 2022). The extent to which international standards are incorporated into domestic law depends on the rules in each state's legal system governing the recognition of international law (Guide to International Law, 2022).

## Dualist and Monist Approaches to International Law

Different states adopt different approaches to the recognition and incorporation of international law into their domestic legal systems. Dualist states, often from the common law tradition, consider international law as not directly part of the domestic legal system unless specific legislation is passed to give effect to it (Guide to International Law, 2022). Examples of dualist states include the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, and Australia (Guide to International Law, 2022).

On the other hand, monist states automatically treat international law as part of the domestic legal system once the state has ratified or acceded to a treaty (Guide to International Law, 2022). Examples of monist states include France, Brazil, Belgium, Argentina, and the Netherlands (Guide to International Law, 2022). However, even in monist states, there may be measures to limit the applicability of international law, such as distinguishing between self-executing and not self-executing treaties (Guide to International Law, 2022).

## Challenges and Limitations of Incorporating International Law

The incorporation of international law into domestic legal systems is not without challenges and limitations. In some cases, there may be confusion and uncertainty regarding the exact incorporation of international norms into domestic legislation (Guide to International Law, 2022). Piecemeal approaches to incorporation can lead to difficulties in determining which international law provisions have been incorporated and which have not (Guide to International Law, 2022).

Furthermore, the recognition of international provisions through statute may not necessarily incorporate legal and authoritative interpretations of those provisions into the domestic system (Guide to International Law, 2022). This raises questions about the extent to which domestic courts should consider international jurisprudence in interpreting domestic legislation (Guide to International Law, 2022).

## Conclusion

The implications of international legal standards on domestic law and policy are multifaceted. International law is integrated into domestic legal systems to varying degrees, with states often changing domestic laws to comply with international agreements. Public opinion plays a role in shaping compliance with international law, with citizens valuing adherence to legally binding commitments.

The incorporation of international standards in domestic litigation can provide a powerful tool for promoting human rights and informing the interpretation of domestic laws. However, challenges and limitations exist in the recognition and incorporation of international law into domestic legal systems, including the need for clarity and consistency in the incorporation process.

Overall, the relationship between international law and domestic law is a complex and evolving one, influenced by factors such as public opinion, constitutional provisions, and the specific legal traditions of each state. The implications of international legal standards on domestic law and policy require careful consideration and ongoing analysis to ensure effective implementation and compliance.
