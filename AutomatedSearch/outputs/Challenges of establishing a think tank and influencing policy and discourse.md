# Challenges of Establishing a Think Tank and Influencing Policy and Discourse

## Introduction

Think tanks play a crucial role in shaping policy and influencing discourse at both national and international levels. These independent research organizations provide valuable insights, analysis, and recommendations to policymakers, helping them make informed decisions. However, establishing a think tank and effectively influencing policy and discourse come with their own set of challenges. This report aims to explore the challenges faced by think tanks in establishing themselves and influencing policy and discourse, drawing insights from various sources.

## 1. Focusing on the Issue Instead of the Country

One of the challenges faced by think tanks is the need to focus on the issue rather than the country. Many think tanks in the global south have valuable knowledge and experience that could contribute significantly to international debates on various issues such as development, trade, or the environment. However, the dominance of knowledge prepared by international organizations or think tanks based in the global north tends to overshadow the perspectives and insights from the global south. This limits the ability of think tanks in the global south to have their research and ideas heard on the international stage [^1^].

## 2. Coordinating with Others

Think tanks, especially those in the global south, often face challenges in coordinating with other think tanks to influence international policy. The diverse nature of think tanks, regional diversity, and competing interests among them make coordination a complex task. International collaboration among think tanks is limited, and establishing effective coordination requires leadership, time, commitment, and trust. Joint ventures and initiatives focusing on collaboration, such as the Southern Voice on Post-MDG, can help address this challenge [^1^].

## 3. Confronting a Different Policy Scenario

When influencing policy at the national level, think tanks interact with various actors involved in the policy process, including decision-makers, implementers, and evaluators. However, in international debates, the policy cycle has its specificities. Think tanks primarily contribute by informing the debate before the decision-making process, which often involves inter-governmental processes. The implementation of international policy often goes back to individual nations, making the process more complex. Navigating these settings requires a better understanding of the policy cycle and the research and knowledge required [^1^].

## 4. Contextual and Organizational Challenges

Think tanks face contextual and organizational challenges that can limit their impact on policy outcomes. In the case of Bangladesh, think tanks have been visible in the policy discourse, fostering debates and advocating policy proposals. However, their direct impact on policy outcomes remains limited. Think tanks' research findings are often interpreted through the prism of politics, and institutional weaknesses, funding challenges, and difficulties in attracting and retaining researchers can hinder their effectiveness. To be more effective and relevant in policy discussions, think tanks can focus on building capacity, wider networking, and interacting with a broader base of policymakers [^3^].

## 5. Competition from Other Knowledge Providers

Think tanks face competition from various other knowledge providers, including universities, NGOs, business associations, multinational corporations, professional bodies, trade unions, and international commissions. These entities have established their own research capacities and can promote their policy perspectives effectively. The rapid dispersion and proliferation of knowledge make it challenging for think tanks to ensure their information is absorbed by policymakers. The management of the supply of evidence and policy analysis becomes a problem of governance, requiring skilled curators and organizations to navigate the information overload [^1^].

## 6. Establishing and Maintaining Independence

Think tanks often face the challenge of establishing and maintaining their independence. It is crucial for think tanks to be perceived as politically unbiased and not academically attached to a specific school of thought. This challenge is particularly significant in contexts where the concept of think tanks is new and not widely understood. Think tanks need to define, rationalize, and legitimize their institutions to gain credibility and trust from policymakers and the public [^2^].

## 7. Fundraising and Financial Sustainability

Funding is a critical challenge for think tanks. Many think tanks struggle to secure sustainable funding sources, which can limit their ability to carry out research, attract qualified researchers, and retain a focused research agenda. Think tanks often rely on a mix of funding from government grants, foundations, private donors, and research contracts. Diversifying funding sources and establishing long-term partnerships can help address this challenge [^2^].

## 8. Shaping the Policy Landscape

Think tanks operate within a larger policy landscape and need to understand their context to effectively shape policy. While they may not be able to change the entire system, think tanks can influence specific parts of it. It is essential for think tanks to envision their future and consider the landscape they aim to shape. This involves thinking about the risks they may face and developing strategies to address them. Reflecting on the future can help think tanks anticipate challenges and adapt their approaches accordingly [^2^].

## Conclusion

Establishing a think tank and influencing policy and discourse come with a range of challenges. Think tanks in the global south face the challenge of focusing on the issue instead of the country, as their perspectives often get overshadowed by dominant knowledge from the global north. Coordinating with other think tanks and establishing international collaboration is crucial but challenging due to the diverse nature and competing interests among think tanks. Think tanks also need to navigate the complexities of the international policy scenario and understand the policy cycle to effectively contribute to the debate. Contextual and organizational challenges, competition from other knowledge providers, establishing and maintaining independence, fundraising, and shaping the policy landscape are additional hurdles that think tanks need to overcome.

Despite these challenges, think tanks remain important actors in shaping policy and influencing discourse. They provide valuable research, analysis, and recommendations that contribute to evidence-based decision-making. By addressing these challenges and leveraging their strengths, think tanks can continue to play a vital role in influencing policy and shaping the future.
