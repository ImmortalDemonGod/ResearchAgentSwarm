# The Relationship Between Pandemic Preparedness and National Security

## Introduction

Pandemics are not random events but rather predictable occurrences that can have significant human and economic costs. The interconnectedness of our global society makes the spread of infectious diseases easier than ever before, highlighting the need for effective pandemic preparedness. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in national and global responses to such crises, emphasizing the critical link between pandemic preparedness and national security. This report aims to explore the relationship between pandemic preparedness and national security, examining the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recommendations put forth by experts and organizations.

## Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on nearly every nation, causing a global economic recession and claiming the lives of millions of people worldwide. The flawed response to the pandemic has revealed the vulnerabilities in national and global health security systems. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) has highlighted the need to treat pandemic preparedness as a serious national and global security threat and invest accordingly. The CFR-sponsored Independent Task Force report emphasizes that future pandemic threats are inevitable and possibly imminent, and policymakers should prepare for them by identifying the shortcomings in the response to COVID-19.

## The Role of National Security Strategies

Successive U.S. administrations, as well as other governments and international organizations, have recognized the importance of pandemic preparedness in national security strategies and intelligence assessments. The United States has acknowledged the need to devote considerable political capital and economic resources to reduce domestic and global vulnerabilities that jeopardize individual, national, and global health security. The American Pandemic Preparedness report emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and coordinated strategy to transform U.S. pandemic preparedness capabilities, including better prevention, detection, and response measures.

## Investing in Pandemic Preparedness

To effectively address the threats posed by pandemics, it is crucial to invest in pandemic preparedness. The United States needs to prioritize pandemic preparedness and allocate sufficient resources to meet the objectives of the Biodefense Strategy's Implementation Plan. This includes increasing overall public health funding, strengthening the public health workforce, improving data systems, addressing disparities, and improving coordination across federal, state, local, and tribal authorities. The American Pandemic Preparedness report calls for significant annual investment over a sustained period to ensure the country is prepared for future pandemics and other major biological threats.

## Multilateral Cooperation and Global Health Security

Pandemic preparedness is not limited to individual nations but requires international cooperation and collaboration. The CFR report emphasizes the need for a more effective multilateral response to pandemics, highlighting the multiple obstacles that have hindered such a response during the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States should work with governments, international organizations, philanthropies, nonprofits, and the private sector to strengthen global pandemic response and enhance global health security. This includes supporting the World Health Organization (WHO) and its lead role in the international health response, as well as establishing new mechanisms to finance pandemic preparedness and response internationally.

## Strengthening Health Systems and Security

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of strengthening health systems to enhance pandemic preparedness and response. The links between health system strengthening and health security have started to emerge in national strategic plans and global initiatives such as the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and One Health. These initiatives aim to facilitate the implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and improve the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Investing in resilient health systems and addressing disparities in access to healthcare are crucial components of pandemic preparedness and national security.

## Conclusion

The relationship between pandemic preparedness and national security is evident in the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. The flaws in the response to the pandemic have highlighted the need to prioritize pandemic preparedness as a core national and global security objective. Governments, including the United States, must invest in pandemic preparedness, strengthen health systems, and enhance global cooperation to effectively prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemics. By treating pandemics as serious national security threats and allocating the necessary resources, nations can mitigate the devastating human and economic costs of future infectious disease outbreaks.
