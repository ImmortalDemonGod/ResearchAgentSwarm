# Effects of Global Literacy Rates on Information Dissemination and Power

## Introduction

Literacy is a fundamental skill that enables individuals to access and understand information, communicate effectively, and participate fully in society. The global literacy rate has seen significant improvements over the past two centuries, with the current global literacy rate standing at 87% (Our World in Data, 2022). This increase in literacy rates has had profound effects on information dissemination and power dynamics worldwide. In this report, we will explore the impact of global literacy rates on information dissemination and power, examining the role of literacy in media and information literacy education, the relationship between literacy and access to information, and the influence of literacy on power dynamics in society.

## Media and Information Literacy Education

Media and information literacy education plays a crucial role in preparing individuals to navigate the fast-paced media environment and critically evaluate the information they encounter. As global literacy rates have increased, the necessity of media and information literacy education has become more apparent (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024). Media literacy education equips individuals with the skills to better cope with and detect fake news, promoting critical thinking and discernment in information consumption (Mele et al., 2017; Mihailidis and Viotty, 2017). It also helps individuals develop an increased awareness of the problems that digitization can bring and fosters a broad understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital world (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024).

Schools have a special responsibility in preparing students for critical and reflective thinking in the modern digital world, and teachers play a key role in providing the necessary skills and competencies (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024). By integrating media and information literacy education into school curricula, students can develop the technical skills and awareness needed to navigate the flood of information on the internet effectively (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024). This education empowers individuals to become active participants in the information ecosystem, enabling them to make informed decisions and contribute to the dissemination of accurate and reliable information.

## Access to Information

Global literacy rates have a direct impact on individuals' access to information. As literacy rates increase, more individuals gain the ability to read and understand written content, opening up a world of knowledge and opportunities. In the past, only a small elite had the ability to read and write, but over the past two centuries, literacy rates have steadily risen (Our World in Data, 2022). Today, the majority of the world's population is literate, with literacy rates above 80% globally (Our World in Data, 2022).

Improved access to information has been facilitated by advancements in technology, particularly the internet. The internet has revolutionized information dissemination, allowing individuals to access information on virtually any topic with just a few clicks (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024). However, the ability to access information does not guarantee its accuracy or reliability. Media and information literacy education becomes crucial in this context, as individuals need to develop the skills to evaluate and discern credible sources of information from misinformation and disinformation (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024).

## Power Dynamics

Literacy rates also have a significant impact on power dynamics within society. Historically, literacy has been closely associated with power, with access to education and information being limited to privileged elites (Oxford Research Encyclopedias, 2022). As literacy rates have increased globally, power dynamics have shifted, and more individuals have gained the ability to participate in decision-making processes and challenge existing power structures.

The democratization of information through increased literacy rates has empowered individuals to voice their opinions, advocate for their rights, and hold those in power accountable (Oxford Research Encyclopedias, 2022). Literacy enables individuals to access information, critically analyze it, and engage in informed discussions and debates. This ability to engage in the public sphere and contribute to the exchange of ideas has the potential to reshape power dynamics within society.

However, it is important to note that power dynamics are complex and multifaceted. While increased literacy rates have the potential to challenge existing power structures, they can also reinforce inequalities if access to education and information remains unequal (Our World in Data, 2022). In many developing countries, there are still substantial challenges in ensuring access to quality education and reducing education inequalities (Our World in Data, 2022). These disparities can perpetuate existing power imbalances and limit the transformative potential of increased literacy rates.

## Conclusion

The impact of global literacy rates on information dissemination and power dynamics is significant. As literacy rates have increased, media and information literacy education has become increasingly important in equipping individuals with the skills to navigate the digital information landscape effectively. Access to information has also improved, allowing individuals to access a wealth of knowledge and opportunities. However, power dynamics remain complex, and inequalities in access to education and information can perpetuate existing power imbalances.

To fully harness the potential of increased literacy rates, it is crucial to ensure equitable access to quality education and promote media and information literacy education for all. By empowering individuals with the skills to critically evaluate information, engage in informed discussions, and challenge existing power structures, we can create a more inclusive and democratic society.
