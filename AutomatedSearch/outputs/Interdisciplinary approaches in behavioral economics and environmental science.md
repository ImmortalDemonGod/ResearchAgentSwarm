# Interdisciplinary Approaches in Behavioral Economics and Environmental Science

## Introduction

Behavioral economics and environmental science are two distinct fields that have increasingly recognized the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex environmental challenges. Behavioral economics combines insights from psychology and economics to understand how individuals make decisions and how these decisions impact the environment. Environmental science, on the other hand, focuses on studying the natural environment and its interactions with human society. By integrating these two disciplines, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and develop more effective strategies for promoting sustainable environmental practices.

This report aims to explore the interdisciplinary approaches in behavioral economics and environmental science, highlighting the research findings, challenges, and potential implications of this intersection. The report will provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of interdisciplinary research, drawing on various scholarly articles and publications.

## Interdisciplinary Influences in Behavioral Economics

A bibliometric analysis conducted by Alexandre Truc (2021) examined the interdisciplinary influences in behavioral economics through a quantitative analysis of cross-disciplinary citations. The study found that interdisciplinarity between economics and psychology in behavioral economics has decreased since the 1980s. However, this decrease has been compensated for by the rise of behavioral economics in the wider field of economics. While individual articles in behavioral economics have become less related to psychology, the overall interdisciplinarity between economics and psychology has intensified due to the growing number of behavioral economics articles in economics as a whole.

Furthermore, the study found that the level of interdisciplinarity between economics and psychology in behavioral economics remains higher than the average economics article, indicating that behavioral economics is distinctively interdisciplinary. This suggests that behavioral economists have diversified their interdisciplinary relationships beyond psychology, with a rise in the importance of management studies and other disciplines in the social and natural sciences.

## Behavioral Environmental Economics: Promises and Challenges

The field of behavioral environmental economics explores the interface between behavioral economics and environmental economics. Rachel Croson and Nicolas Treich (2014) discuss the promises and challenges of this growing literature. They highlight the identification of alternative solutions to traditional economic instruments in environmental domains that often work imperfectly. Behavioral environmental economics offers insights into the limitations of human decision-making and the consequences of these limitations for environmental policy.

One of the challenges faced by behavioral environmental economics is the difficulty of computing welfare effects. Traditional economic instruments rely on the assumption of rational decision-making, which may not accurately capture the complexities of human behavior. Behavioral environmental economics seeks to incorporate context-dependent (socio-) psychological effects into the identification of robust environmental policies. This requires a deeper understanding of how individuals' behavior is influenced by social and psychological factors in different environmental contexts.

Croson and Treich (2014) illustrate their discussion with two widely implemented behavioral schemes: "green nudges" and "corporate environmental responsibility." Green nudges refer to interventions that use behavioral insights to encourage individuals to make more sustainable choices. Corporate environmental responsibility focuses on the role of businesses in adopting environmentally friendly practices. These behavioral schemes highlight the potential of behavioral environmental economics to provide alternative solutions to traditional economic instruments in environmental policy.

## Insights from Behavioral Economic and Neuroeconomic Investigations

A review article by Pallant et al. (2020) explores the insights from behavioral economic and neuroeconomic investigations focusing on environmental values. The authors highlight the importance of identifying mechanisms of real-life human decision-making to inform effective, human-centric public policy. The review covers different levels of granularity, from individual-level insights into how individuals value natural resources to social group-level evidence on group externalities, common pool resources, and social norms. It also includes the study of incentives, policies, and their impact at the institutional level.

The authors identify viable directions for future scientific research and actionable items for policymakers. They suggest that coupled with new technological and methodological advances, behavioral economic and neuroeconomic insights may inform an effective strategy to optimize environmental resources. The review emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address the complex challenges of environmental decision-making and policy implementation.

## The Role of AI and Paradigm Shifts

In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in bridging the gap between science and policy in environmental sustainability. AI has the ability to overcome information asymmetries and the bias of human emotions, which are barriers to developing solutions for environmental challenges (Cullen-Knox et al., 2017). Leveraging AI to analyze large-scale data and patterns can provide valuable insights for science-based solutions and policies.

However, the adoption of AI in environmental decision-making requires a paradigm shift. The current self-interested reductionist paradigm often leads to simplistic and irrational solutions to complex environmental problems (Cox & Raja, 2007). A paradigm shift towards a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to devise effective science-based solutions and policies. This shift involves integrating AI technologies with interdisciplinary research and considering the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainability.

## Conclusion

The intersection of behavioral economics and environmental science offers valuable insights into human decision-making and its impact on the environment. Interdisciplinary approaches in this field have expanded beyond the traditional boundaries of economics and psychology, incorporating insights from management studies and other disciplines in the social and natural sciences. This interdisciplinary collaboration has led to a deeper understanding of human behavior and the development of alternative solutions to traditional economic instruments in environmental policy.

Behavioral environmental economics identifies the promises and challenges of integrating behavioral insights into environmental economics. It highlights the importance of considering context-dependent (socio-) psychological effects in the design of robust environmental policies. The field also explores behavioral schemes such as "green nudges" and "corporate environmental responsibility" as potential solutions to promote sustainable behavior.

Insights from behavioral economic and neuroeconomic investigations provide valuable guidance for policymakers in developing human-centric public policies. The integration of AI technologies in environmental decision-making offers new opportunities to optimize environmental resources and overcome barriers to sustainability. However, this requires a paradigm shift towards a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach.

In conclusion, interdisciplinary approaches in behavioral economics and environmental science have the potential to address complex environmental challenges and inform effective policy interventions. By integrating insights from psychology, economics, and other disciplines, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and develop innovative strategies for promoting sustainable environmental practices.
