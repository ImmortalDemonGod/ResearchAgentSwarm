# Control of Technology in Access to Information and Power

## Introduction

In today's digital age, technology plays a crucial role in shaping access to information and power. The rapid advancements in digital technologies have transformed societies, economies, and governance systems worldwide. While technology has the potential to create a fairer and more just world, it also presents challenges and risks that need to be addressed. This report explores the control of technology in access to information and power, examining its impact on various aspects of society, including social, political, economic, and ethical dimensions.

## The Impact of Digital Technologies on Society

Digital technologies have the potential to support and accelerate the achievement of sustainable development goals, such as ending extreme poverty, reducing maternal and infant mortality, promoting sustainable farming and decent work, and achieving universal literacy (United Nations, n.d.). These technologies have advanced more rapidly than any innovation in history, reaching around 50% of the developing world's population in just two decades (United Nations, n.d.). They have transformed societies by enhancing connectivity, financial inclusion, access to trade and public services, and have the potential to be a great equalizer (United Nations, n.d.).

In the health sector, AI-enabled frontier technologies have helped save lives, diagnose diseases, and extend life expectancy (United Nations, n.d.). In education, virtual learning environments and distance learning have opened up opportunities for students who would otherwise be excluded (United Nations, n.d.). Public services are becoming more accessible and accountable through blockchain-powered systems, and big data can support more responsive and accurate policies and programs (United Nations, n.d.). These advancements demonstrate the positive impact of technology on access to information and power.

However, technology also presents challenges and risks. It can threaten privacy, erode security, and fuel inequality (United Nations, n.d.). The emergence of the term "technology" in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries marked a shift from viewing individual pieces of machinery as a means to achieving political and social progress to a more hazardous view (United Nations, n.d.). Technology can embed biases in automated decision-making processes and information-processing algorithms, exacerbating economic and social inequalities within and between countries (United Nations, n.d.). It can also create new weapons and avenues for attack, posing unprecedented challenges to security (United Nations, n.d.).

## Technology and the Shifting Balance of Power

The ability of nations or groups to take advantage of technological change and adopt technology has become the key to national power (Center for Strategic and International Studies, n.d.). However, advanced technology does not automatically confer power, as other factors such as political culture, policies, organization, geographic size, and population also play a significant role (Center for Strategic and International Studies, n.d.). Leadership, whether skillful or inept, may be the most immediate determinant of power (Center for Strategic and International Studies, n.d.).

The diffusion of the ability to create new technologies has not been as great as predicted, with advanced technologies deriving more from the commercial technology sector than from governments and defense firms (Center for Strategic and International Studies, n.d.). The long-term effect of technology in shaping global competition may be its role in the diffusion of power among governmental and non-governmental actors (Center for Strategic and International Studies, n.d.). Countries that can take advantage of private and commercial resources and exploit technological developments will do better comparatively in business and military power (Center for Strategic and International Studies, n.d.).

## Challenges in Access Control Systems

As technology advances, access control systems face both opportunities and challenges. Automated buildings with advanced building management control systems can enhance security and prevent theft (Schneider Electric Blog, n.d.). However, shifting from traditional security systems to modern-day systems poses challenges (Schneider Electric Blog, n.d.). Key challenges include ensuring network connectivity does not make data prone to unauthorized access, breaches, or unwanted data retrieval centers (Schneider Electric Blog, n.d.). The challenge lies in preventing hacks and breaches from any corner of the world when the system is connected through the internet (Schneider Electric Blog, n.d.).

In the cloud computing environment, access control becomes a significant concern due to the support of multiple tenants (Springer, n.d.). Preventing malicious users from accessing and manipulating data they have no right to access is a challenge (Springer, n.d.). Various access control techniques have been proposed, but they often focus on specific authorization issues, neglecting other weaknesses such as lack of interoperability and management issues in the dynamic cloud environment (Springer, n.d.).

## Technology and the Political Environment

Technology has had a significant impact on the political environment, both positive and negative. On one hand, technology has made people more informed about current events and has improved access to news (Pew Research Center, 2019). Mobile phones, the internet, and social media have provided people with access to a wide range of information (Pew Research Center, 2019). On the other hand, technology has made it easier to manipulate people with false information and rumors (Pew Research Center, 2019). The spread of fake news and propaganda has become a significant problem, posing challenges to privacy, accuracy, and accessibility (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.).

Technology companies, as surveillance intermediaries, play a crucial role in government surveillance (Harvard Law Review, n.d.). The approaches of technology companies in their roles as surveillance intermediaries vary significantly, with some companies cooperating more with law enforcement than others (Harvard Law Review, n.d.). The centralization of communication through technology companies has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for government overreach (Harvard Law Review, n.d.). The role of technology companies as surveillance intermediaries has become a subject of debate, with some arguing for more regulation and others highlighting the profit incentives driving their behavior (Harvard Law Review, n.d.).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology

Technology brings both advantages and disadvantages to society. On the positive side, technology provides access to more information than ever before, allowing individuals to gain multiple perspectives and stay connected with others (Vittana, n.d.). It has the potential to transform various sectors, including media, climate action, and healthcare (World Economic Forum, n.d.). Technology can also lead to social and civic innovation, empowering individuals to raise their voices and counter societal ills (Harvard Law Review, n.d.).

However, technology also has its drawbacks. It can be addictive, leading to a distraction from real-life interactions and a loss of privacy (Vittana, n.d.). The rapid pace of technological change makes it challenging for laws and regulations to keep up, potentially compromising individual freedoms (Vittana, n.d.). Technology can also have dangerous outcomes, such as the development of nuclear weapons or the misuse of personal data (Vittana, n.d.). The impact of technology on society depends on how it is controlled and regulated.

## Conclusion

The control of technology in access to information and power has both positive and negative implications for society. Digital technologies have the potential to create a fairer and more just world by enhancing connectivity, financial inclusion, and access to public services. However, technology also poses challenges, such as threats to privacy, security, and the exacerbation of inequalities. The role of technology companies as surveillance intermediaries and the impact of technology on the political environment raise concerns about privacy, government overreach, and the manipulation of information.

To ensure the positive impact of technology, it is crucial to address these challenges and risks. Governments, businesses, and individuals must make informed choices in harnessing and managing new technologies. Regulation and policies need to keep pace with technological advancements to protect individual rights and ensure a balance between privacy and security. Additionally, efforts should be made to bridge the digital divide and ensure equal access to technology and information.

In conclusion, technology has the potential to empower individuals, enhance access to information, and drive positive change. However, it also requires responsible governance, ethical considerations, and a focus on addressing the challenges and risks associated with its control. By striking the right balance, society can harness the benefits of technology while mitigating its potential negative impacts.
