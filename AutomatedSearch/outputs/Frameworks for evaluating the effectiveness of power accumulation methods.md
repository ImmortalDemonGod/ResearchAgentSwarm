## Evaluation Frameworks for Power Accumulation Methods

Evaluation frameworks provide a structured approach to assess the performance of power accumulation methods. These frameworks typically consider multiple dimensions, such as environmental, economic, and technical aspects, to provide a comprehensive evaluation. The following evaluation frameworks have been commonly used in the assessment of power accumulation methods:

1. Triple Bottom Line (TBL) Framework: The TBL framework is one of the most commonly used evaluation frameworks for power system performance evaluation. It considers three dimensions: environmental, social, and economic. The TBL framework aims to evaluate the sustainability of power systems by assessing their impact on the environment, society, and economy. The environmental dimension focuses on factors such as carbon emissions and resource depletion. The social dimension considers the social impact of power systems on communities and stakeholders. The economic dimension evaluates the financial viability and cost-effectiveness of power accumulation methods.

2. Expanded Triple Bottom Line (ETBL) Framework: The ETBL framework extends the TBL framework by incorporating additional dimensions, such as technology and governance. The technology dimension evaluates the technical sustainability of power systems, including the efficiency and reliability of power accumulation methods. The governance dimension assesses the regulatory and policy frameworks governing power systems and their impact on sustainability.

3. Sustainable Balanced Scorecard (SBSC): The SBSC is an integrated evaluation framework that combines the traditional balanced scorecard approach with the TBL framework. It aims to provide a holistic assessment of power system performance by considering financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth perspectives. The SBSC framework incorporates sustainability indicators into each perspective to evaluate the environmental, social, and economic performance of power accumulation methods.
