# Intersectionality and Power Dynamics in Workplace Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives

## Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Organizations are increasingly realizing that a diverse workforce can bring a range of perspectives, ideas, and experiences that can lead to innovation and better decision-making. However, it is essential to understand that diversity is not a one-dimensional concept. Individuals have multiple social identities that intersect and interact with each other, creating unique experiences and challenges. This concept is known as intersectionality.

Intersectionality, a term coined by Kimberl√© Crenshaw in 1989, refers to the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, gender, class, sexuality, and disability, and how they overlap and intersect to shape an individual's experiences and opportunities. It recognizes that individuals can face multiple forms of discrimination and disadvantage based on their intersecting identities.

In the context of workplace diversity and inclusion initiatives, understanding intersectionality is crucial for creating an inclusive environment that addresses the unique challenges faced by individuals with intersecting identities. This report explores the role of intersectionality in power dynamics within the workplace and its implications for diversity and inclusion initiatives.

## Power Structures and Intersectionality in the Workplace

Societal power structures shape workplace culture, human resources practices, and organizational roles, all of which affect workers' intersectional experiences and put some at a disadvantage (Haslam, 2021). Based on stereotypes about intersecting identities, some team members may expect specific workers to take on certain responsibilities beyond their official duties, perpetuating biases and limiting opportunities for individuals with intersecting identities (Haslam, 2021).

For example, Hispanic immigrant women may experience compounded negative effects such as harsh working conditions and limited career opportunities, while white immigrant women may enjoy racial privileges that offset the disadvantages of their gender and immigrant status (Haslam, 2021). This highlights the importance of considering the specific identity combinations and the environment in which individuals operate when examining the effects of intersectionality in the workplace (Haslam, 2021).

## Empowering Intersectional Workers

Empowering intersectional workers is crucial for reducing the disadvantages associated with their intersecting identities. Studies show that when workers feel empowered to oppose inequalities, they can mitigate the negative impact of intersectionality (Haslam, 2021). On the other hand, when workers feel powerless, they often passively endure inequalities and have a negative outlook toward work and life (Haslam, 2021).

Managers play a vital role in empowering intersectional workers. They can proactively intervene when instances of discrimination, stereotyping, or incivility occur, putting intersectional workers at a disadvantage relative to others (Haslam, 2021). Additionally, managers can help workers identify strategies for drawing on their intersectionality, such as sponsoring employees' participation in leadership development programs or executive coaching (Haslam, 2021). Mentoring relationships among intersectional workers can also provide guidance for navigating the organization and its power structures (Haslam, 2021).

## Expanding the Scope and Role of DEI Initiatives

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives play a crucial role in addressing intersectionality in the workplace. To ensure that no one is left out, companies need to collect and analyze data on pay and employee engagement, separating out variables of race, gender, sexual orientation, or physical ability (World Economic Forum, 2020). Targets for DEI programs should include gender representation as well as racial inclusion at different levels of the organization (World Economic Forum, 2020).

Unconscious bias training should be designed with intersectionality in mind, considering the complex interplay of various social identities (World Economic Forum, 2020). Companies should be willing to try new approaches if traditional initiatives do not result in equal access to opportunities for individuals with intersectional lived experiences (World Economic Forum, 2020). Disaggregated data can help assess the effectiveness of these initiatives and identify areas for improvement (World Economic Forum, 2020).

## Intersectionality Research and Practice

Despite the value of understanding employees' intersectional experiences for DEI initiatives, the management field lacks a comprehensive review of intersectionality research (Thatcher, Hymer, & Arwine, 2021). A review of 153 intersectionality studies published in leading management journals between 1989 and 2021 found a diverse but consistent set of intersectionality experiences, with a pattern of negative outcomes for employees with multiple disadvantaged identities (Thatcher et al., 2021).

The review also highlighted the importance of context in understanding intersectionality. For example, Black men may experience reduced career mobility options compared to white men, but their male identity puts them at an advantage compared to Black women (Thatcher et al., 2021). The review calls for further research on intersectionality, considering identity representation, contextual and analytical considerations, and theoretical extensions (Thatcher et al., 2021).

## Intersectionality and Inclusion in Business

An intersectional approach is crucial for tackling diversity and inclusion in business effectively. Focusing solely on gender and race can miss a whole host of inequality issues, including disability and social mobility (World Economic Forum, 2020). An intersectional approach recognizes the complexity of individuals' identities and the need to address multiple forms of discrimination and disadvantage (World Economic Forum, 2020).

Businesses need to understand the importance of intersectionality and its role in shaping diversity and inclusion initiatives. Intersectionality should be hardwired into the future of businesses and their supply chains (World Economic Forum, 2020). By considering intersectionality, businesses can ensure that their diversity strategies are comprehensive and address the experiences of individuals with intersecting identities (World Economic Forum, 2020).

## Conclusion

Intersectionality plays a crucial role in understanding power dynamics within workplace diversity and inclusion initiatives. It recognizes the interconnected nature of social identities and the unique challenges faced by individuals with intersecting identities. Organizations need to empower intersectional workers, challenge existing power structures, and expand the scope and role of DEI initiatives to create inclusive workplaces.

Managers have a responsibility to intervene when instances of discrimination or bias occur and to empower workers to draw on their intersectionality. DEI initiatives should collect and analyze data on various social identities, set targets for representation, and design training programs with intersectionality in mind. Further research is needed to deepen our understanding of intersectionality and its implications for workplace dynamics.

By embracing intersectionality, organizations can create a more inclusive and equitable workplace that values and respects the diverse experiences and identities of their employees.
