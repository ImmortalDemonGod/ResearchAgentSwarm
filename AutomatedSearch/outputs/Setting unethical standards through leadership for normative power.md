# Report: Setting Unethical Standards through Leadership for Normative Power

## Introduction

Leadership plays a crucial role in shaping the ethical standards and norms within an organization. The actions and behaviors of leaders have a significant impact on the ethical climate and culture of an organization. Unethical leadership, characterized by behaviors that violate normative standards, can have detrimental effects on employees, stakeholders, and the overall success of the organization. This report aims to explore the concept of unethical leadership, its impact on setting unethical standards, and the potential for normative power.

## Understanding Unethical Leadership

Unethical leadership refers to supervisory behaviors that deviate from accepted ethical standards. Ünal et al. (2012) conducted a seminal study to develop a comprehensive understanding of unethical leadership. They differentiated unethical leadership from other leadership styles and the lack of exemplary ethical leader behaviors. The study utilized various ethical perspectives, including virtue ethics, deontology, teleology, and utilitarianism, to establish normative foundations for unethical leadership practices.

Unethical leadership can manifest in various ways, including the violation of employee rights, unfair justice mechanisms, and the promotion of an unethical climate within the organization (Brown et al., 2005). It is important to note that the definition of unethical leadership can be subjective and culturally influenced, as the manifestations of unethical behaviors vary across different contexts (Resick et al., 2011).

## Famous Examples of Unethical Leadership

To illustrate the impact of unethical leadership, it is helpful to examine famous examples from history. One such example is the Enron scandal, led by CEO Jeffrey Skilling. Enron, once the largest natural gas provider in the US, engaged in fraudulent accounting practices to inflate its revenue artificially. Skilling used accounting methods such as mark-to-market to make the company appear more profitable than it was. However, when the contracts did not turn out to be profitable, Enron failed to make corrections, leading to the company's downfall (Rigorous Themes).

These examples highlight the destructive consequences of unethical leadership and the importance of ethical conduct in leadership positions. Unethical leaders can undermine trust, damage reputation, and lead organizations towards failure.

## Ethical Culture and Leadership

Ethical culture within an organization is strongly influenced by leadership practices. Leaders have the power to shape the ethical climate and promote ethical behavior among employees. Ethical leadership involves demonstrating normatively appropriate conduct through personal actions, interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of ethical conduct to followers (Brown et al., 2005).

Research has shown that ethical leadership has positive effects on various follower outcomes, including task performance, perceived leader effectiveness, organizational citizenship behavior, and ethical behaviors (Bouckenooghe et al., 2015; Mayer et al., 2009; Piccolo et al., 2010). Ethical leaders serve as role models, setting the tone for ethical behavior and creating an environment where ethical conduct is valued and rewarded.

## The Role of Power in Ethical Leadership

Power is an integral part of leadership, and its responsible use is crucial for ethical leadership. Power can be used to serve the greater good or abused for selfish ends (Baltasar Gracian). Ethical leaders understand the importance of using their power to benefit society and promote ethical behavior within their organizations (Clements and Washbush, 1999).

Personal power, the ability to influence others based on personal characteristics and expertise, plays a significant role in ethical leadership. Ethical leaders who demonstrate integrity, fairness, and care can gain personal power and influence their followers positively (Frontiers in Psychology).

## Building an Ethical Culture

Creating an ethical culture within an organization requires a concerted effort from leaders at all levels. Integrating ethics into the corporate culture is essential, and it should go beyond simply stating ethical guidelines. Companies can incorporate ethics-related questions in job interviews, outline values during onboarding, offer job-specific ethics training, and make ethical conduct a regular part of performance reviews (Kellogg Insight).

Promoting humility among leaders and employees is another important aspect of building an ethical culture. Recognizing the natural human tendency toward moral overconfidence and creating a psychologically safe environment where learning from failure is allowed can foster ethical behavior (Kellogg Insight).

## Conclusion

Unethical leadership has far-reaching consequences for organizations and their stakeholders. Leaders have the power to shape the ethical climate and culture within an organization, either by setting ethical standards and promoting ethical behavior or by engaging in unethical conduct and allowing unethical behaviors to flourish.

Ethical leadership, on the other hand, can have positive effects on employee outcomes, organizational performance, and stakeholder trust. Ethical leaders serve as role models, promote ethical conduct, and create an environment where ethical behavior is valued and rewarded.

To build an ethical culture, organizations should integrate ethics into their corporate culture, promote humility, and create a psychologically safe environment where learning from failure is encouraged. By doing so, organizations can foster ethical behavior, mitigate the risks of unethical conduct, and promote sustainable business practices.
