# Evaluating Outcomes of Bayesian-Informed Decisions in Educational Reforms

## Introduction

In recent years, educational reforms have been driven by the need to address the challenges and opportunities presented by digital technology, as well as the desire to improve educational outcomes for students. Bayesian-informed decisions have played a crucial role in shaping these reforms, providing a framework for making evidence-based policy choices. This report aims to evaluate the outcomes of Bayesian-informed decisions in educational reforms, drawing on the information provided.

## Importance of Evidence-Based Education Policies

The report from ExcelinEd highlights the importance of high-impact, evidence-based education policies in 2024. The education landscape has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with many states enacting policies to close learning gaps, empower families with opportunities, and reimagine how and where students learn. These reforms have been driven by the need to strengthen students' pathways into college and careers, improve early literacy, and attract and retain teachers.

## Impact of Early Literacy Policies

According to the report, 18 states improved their early literacy policies in 2023. These policies are grounded in the science of reading and aim to ensure that students develop strong reading skills at an early age. By focusing on evidence-based practices, such as phonics instruction, these policies have the potential to improve reading outcomes for students. The implementation of early literacy policies is an example of how Bayesian-informed decisions can lead to positive educational reforms.

## Expansion of Education Scholarship Account (ESA) Programs

The report also highlights the expansion of education scholarship account (ESA) programs in several states. Eight states expanded or adopted new ESA programs in 2023, making 4.07 million students eligible for universal ESAs in five states. ESAs provide families with the flexibility to choose the educational options that best meet their children's needs. By involving parents in the expenditure approval process and expanding the list of allowable education expenditures, these programs aim to create strong choice programs that empower families and attract high-quality education providers.

## Career Scholarship Accounts in Indiana

Indiana broke ground with a first-of-its-kind Career Scholarship Accounts program, where high schoolers who participate in a workforce training program receive $5,000 scholarships to pay for courses, training, or apprenticeship costs. This innovative program aims to create educational pathways for students into college or higher skill, higher-wage, in-demand careers. By providing financial support for career-focused education, Indiana's Career Scholarship Accounts program aligns with ExcelinEd's Pathways Matter policy framework, which offers up to 20 different policies to help states achieve similar goals.

## AI in Education

The report also mentions that some states, like Indiana, are offering districts pilot grants to trial AI in select schools. Early reports have emphasized the usefulness of AI as a complement to teachers' work and the positive effects such tools can have on students' academic progress. The integration of AI in education is an example of how Bayesian-informed decisions can drive educational reforms that leverage technology to enhance learning outcomes.

## Challenges and Emerging Trends

While the education policy trends highlighted in the report demonstrate outstanding progress, they also underscore the ongoing need for proactive policymaking to address present and emerging challenges in education. The choices made by state leaders significantly shape the educational experiences of students, the working conditions of teachers, and the overall well-being of communities. Therefore, it is crucial to continue to evaluate the outcomes of Bayesian-informed decisions and make evidence-based adjustments to educational policies.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Bayesian-informed decisions have played a crucial role in driving educational reforms in recent years. The focus on evidence-based policies, such as early literacy programs, ESAs, and career scholarship accounts, has the potential to improve educational outcomes for students and create pathways to success. The integration of AI in education also presents opportunities to enhance learning experiences. However, it is important to continue evaluating the outcomes of these reforms and make evidence-based adjustments to ensure their effectiveness. State lawmakers should continue to seek out expert guidance and research to inform their decision-making and shape the future of education policy.
