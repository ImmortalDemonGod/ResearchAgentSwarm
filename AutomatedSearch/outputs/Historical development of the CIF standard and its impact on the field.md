# Historical Development of the CIF Standard and Its Impact on the Field

## Introduction

The CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) standard is a file format and data exchange mechanism that was developed to facilitate the sharing and dissemination of crystallographic information. It was initially designed as a standard file format for single-crystal structure reports but has since evolved to encompass a broader range of applications in crystallography and other structural science fields. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the historical development of the CIF standard and its impact on the field.

## Origins of CIF

The development of the CIF standard can be traced back to the early 1970s when Mario Nardelli, a structural chemist, launched the journal Crystal Structure Communications. The journal adopted rigorous standards of checking for reported structures, and these standards were later formalized by Sidney Abrahams, the Editor-in-Chief, who identified the need for a standardized format to capture the information necessary to repeat a crystal structure determination.

In the late 1980s, a Working Party on Crystallographic Information was convened by the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) under the leadership of Ted Maslen. The working party aimed to develop a standard format for crystallographic information that would enable the exchange and validation of crystal structure data. This led to the collaboration between Jim Stewart, Syd Hall, Frank Allen, and David Brown, who developed CIF as a standard format in 1991.

## Evolution and Extensions of CIF

Since its inception, CIF has grown beyond its original design as a standard file format for single-crystal structure reports. It has been extended to encompass a wide range of crystallographic and structural science applications. The acronym CIF now stands for "Crystallographic Information Framework," reflecting its application across various fields.

The flexibility of CIF lies in its definitions of concepts and quantities rather than the concrete file format itself. While the CIF file format is a useful information exchange mechanism, it can be easily translated to other common standards such as XML, the old PDB format, or JSON. This adaptability has contributed to the widespread adoption of CIF in different scientific domains.

## Significance and Impact of CIF

The CIF standard has had a significant impact on the field of crystallography and structural science. It has provided a standardized framework for capturing and exchanging experimental and derived data with precision and scope. This has been crucial in achieving the goals of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management strategy.

One of the key advantages of CIF is its ability to capture all the information necessary to repeat a crystal structure determination. This has become increasingly important with the rise of electronic computers as research tools. CIF has enabled researchers to store and exchange comprehensive data sets, ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of crystallographic research.

The adoption of CIF has also facilitated collaboration and data sharing among researchers. By providing a common language and format for crystallographic information, CIF has enabled researchers to easily exchange data and compare results. This has accelerated scientific progress and contributed to the development of new insights and discoveries in the field.

Furthermore, CIF has played a crucial role in the development of databases and repositories for crystallographic data. For example, CIF has served as the basis for the NMR structures database of BioMagResBank, a partner of the wwPDB (Worldwide Protein Data Bank). The use of CIF in these databases has ensured the consistency and interoperability of crystallographic data, making them accessible to the scientific community.

## Standardization and Governance of CIF

To prevent the development of CIF dialects and ensure adherence to established standards, the IUCr has applied for a patent on the STAR (Self-Defining Text Archive and Retrieval) file structure and has copyrighted the CIF dictionary. The IUCr has established a committee called COMCIFS (Commission on Crystallographic Information File Standards) to review proposals for extensions to the CIF dictionary and ensure their conformity to the STAR syntax and existing conventions.

The governance and standardization of CIF have been essential in maintaining the integrity and consistency of crystallographic information. By establishing clear guidelines and protocols, the IUCr and COMCIFS have ensured that CIF remains a reliable and widely accepted standard in the field.

## Future Outlook for CIF

Looking ahead, CIF is expected to continue evolving and expanding its applications in crystallography and other structural science fields. While the adoption of CIF2 files, which are extensions of the original CIF standard, has been relatively limited, there is potential for their increased use in newer areas of research.

The real power of CIF lies in its ability to define concepts and quantities, rather than the specific file format. This flexibility allows CIF to adapt to emerging technologies and standards, such as XML and JSON. As new techniques, structural representations, and understanding emerge, CIF will need to gather and incorporate more material from these "snowfields" to remain relevant and effective.

## Conclusion

The CIF standard has played a pivotal role in the field of crystallography and structural science. Its development and widespread adoption have facilitated the exchange and validation of crystallographic information, enabling researchers to share data, collaborate, and make significant scientific advancements.

CIF's impact extends beyond its original design as a file format for single-crystal structure reports. It has become a framework for capturing and exchanging experimental and derived data in various scientific domains. The standardization and governance of CIF by the IUCr and COMCIFS have ensured its integrity and consistency.

As technology continues to advance and new research techniques emerge, CIF will need to adapt and incorporate these developments to remain a relevant and effective standard. The future of CIF lies in its ability to evolve and meet the changing needs of the scientific community, ensuring the continued progress and success of crystallography and structural science.
