# Mechanisms of Power Resistance and Subversion in Oppressed Societies

## Introduction

Oppressed societies are characterized by the existence of power imbalances, where a dominant group exercises control and authority over a marginalized group. In such societies, the oppressed often face various forms of discrimination, exploitation, and violence. However, throughout history, oppressed groups have developed mechanisms of power resistance and subversion to challenge and overcome their oppressors. This report aims to explore these mechanisms and shed light on the strategies employed by the oppressed to weaken the power of their oppressors.

## Divide and Conquer

One strategy used by the oppressed to weaken their oppressors is the tactic of "divide and conquer." This strategy involves identifying potential allies among the oppressors and exploiting or creating divisions within the dominant group. By creating antagonism among different factions within the oppressor group, the oppressed can undermine their unity and weaken their power (Deutsch, n.d.).

Various techniques can be employed to create or increase antagonism among different factions within the oppressor group. These techniques include planting rumors, creating incidents, making offers that favor one faction over another, and distorting communication processes to foster mistrust and hostility among different factions (Deutsch, n.d.).

## Violence

Violence is another strategy that has been employed by the oppressed to resist and subvert the power of their oppressors. While violence has some positive features, such as drawing attention to the needs of the oppressed and empowering those who feel enraged and humiliated, it also has considerable negatives (Deutsch, n.d.).

Violence can get the attention of those in high power who have previously paid little attention to the oppressed and their needs. Additionally, if well-focused and executed, violence may weaken the oppressed group. However, violence can also have negative consequences, such as legitimizing the oppressor's actions and leading to further violence and instability (Deutsch, n.d.).

It is important to note that violence as a strategy of resistance is not always effective. Nonviolent strategies have been found to be more successful in achieving social change and challenging oppressive regimes. Research by Chenoweth and Stephan (2011) demonstrates that nonviolent civil resistance campaigns are more likely to succeed than violent ones. They found that nonviolent campaigns have a success rate of 53%, compared to only 26% for violent campaigns (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011).

## Nonviolent Resistance

Nonviolent resistance is a powerful mechanism employed by oppressed societies to challenge and subvert the power of their oppressors. Nonviolent resistance involves the use of peaceful means, such as protests, strikes, boycotts, and civil disobedience, to bring about social and political change (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011).

Nonviolent resistance has been proven to be effective in various historical contexts. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States, led by figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., used nonviolent tactics to challenge racial segregation and discrimination. Similarly, the Indian independence movement, led by Mahatma Gandhi, employed nonviolent resistance to challenge British colonial rule (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011).

Nonviolent resistance works by mobilizing a critical mass of the population to challenge the legitimacy and authority of the oppressor. Research by Chenoweth and Stephan (2011) suggests that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to succeed when they involve the active participation of at least 3.5% of the population. This critical mass of people can exert significant pressure on the oppressor and create a tipping point for change (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011).

## Allies and Third Parties

Allies and third parties play a crucial role in power resistance and subversion in oppressed societies. Allies are individuals or groups from within the dominant group who support the cause of the oppressed and work towards challenging the power dynamics. These allies can help awaken a sense of injustice in the oppressor and increase the bargaining power of the oppressed (Deutsch, n.d.).

Third parties, such as international organizations, NGOs, or influential individuals, can also play a vital role in supporting the oppressed and facilitating a constructive, nonviolent process of conflict resolution and social change. They can provide resources, mediation, and advocacy to amplify the voices of the oppressed and put pressure on the oppressor to address their grievances (Deutsch, n.d.).

## Economic Resistance

Economic resistance is another mechanism employed by oppressed societies to challenge the power of their oppressors. Economic resistance involves boycotting products or services associated with the oppressor, engaging in strikes or labor actions, and creating alternative economic systems that empower the oppressed (Deutsch, n.d.).

Boycotts have been used as a powerful tool to challenge oppressive regimes and corporations. For example, the Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States, led by Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., successfully challenged racial segregation on public buses by organizing a mass boycott of the bus system (Deutsch, n.d.).

## Subversion and Infiltration

Subversion and infiltration are tactics employed by oppressed societies to undermine hostile or unfriendly regimes. These tactics involve the use of front groups, riots, strikes, and infiltration to disrupt the functioning of the oppressive regime (War on the Rocks, 2014).

Historically, subversion and infiltration have been used by both state actors and non-state actors to challenge oppressive regimes. For example, during the Cold War, intelligence agencies such as MI6 engaged in subversive activities to undermine Soviet-controlled territories (War on the Rocks, 2014).

Insurgent and terrorist groups have also employed subversion and infiltration to physically and metaphorically separate target populations from incumbent regimes. Groups like the Viet Cong/National Liberation Front, the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front in El Salvador used intimidation, propaganda, and control measures to challenge oppressive regimes (War on the Rocks, 2014).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, oppressed societies employ various mechanisms of power resistance and subversion to challenge and weaken their oppressors. Strategies such as divide and conquer, nonviolent resistance, economic resistance, and subversion and infiltration have been used throughout history to challenge power imbalances and bring about social and political change.

Nonviolent resistance has proven to be particularly effective in achieving social change and challenging oppressive regimes. By mobilizing a critical mass of the population and employing peaceful means, oppressed societies can challenge the legitimacy and authority of their oppressors.

Allies and third parties also play a crucial role in supporting the oppressed and facilitating a constructive process of conflict resolution and social change. Economic resistance, through boycotts and alternative economic systems, can also undermine the power of the oppressor.

It is important to note that the effectiveness of these mechanisms may vary depending on the specific context and dynamics of the oppressed society. However, the examples and strategies discussed in this report provide valuable insights into the ways in which power resistance and subversion can be employed to challenge oppression.
