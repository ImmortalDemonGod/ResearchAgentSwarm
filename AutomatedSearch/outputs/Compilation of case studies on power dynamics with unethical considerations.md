# Compilation of Case Studies on Power Dynamics with Unethical Considerations

## Introduction

Power dynamics play a significant role in shaping ethical decision-making within organizations and social institutions. Understanding the impact of power differentials on ethical behavior is crucial for creating a fair and just society. This report aims to compile case studies that explore power dynamics and their relationship with unethical considerations. By examining these case studies, we can gain insights into the complexities of power perceptions and their implications for ethical decision-making.

## Case Study 1: "Ethics & Team Power Dynamics in Authorship Decisions"

In the case study titled "Ethics & Team Power Dynamics in Authorship Decisions" by Cheruvelil et al. (2019), the authors investigate the power dynamics within research teams and their influence on authorship decisions. The study highlights the challenges faced by early-career researchers in navigating power dynamics within their teams. The findings suggest that power differentials can impact the fairness and transparency of authorship decisions, potentially leading to unethical practices (Cheruvelil et al., 2019).

## Case Study 2: "Power Dynamics in Community-Based Participatory Research"

Another case study by Zhang and Wei (2023) explores power dynamics in community-based participatory research (CBPR). The study analyzes multiple cases to understand the partnering contexts, histories, and practices that influence power dynamics in CBPR. The findings reveal the presence of oppressive power exerted within communities and through the research enterprise, as well as the potential for emancipatory power based on leveraging community strengths (Zhang & Wei, 2023).

## Case Study 3: "When Two Leaders on the Senior Team Hate Each Other"

The case study titled "When Two Leaders on the Senior Team Hate Each Other" presents a fictional scenario in which the CEO of a sports apparel manufacturer faces a conflict between two top executives. The tension between the head of sales and the CFO affects their teams and the organization as a whole. The CEO must navigate the power dynamics and make decisions to address the conflict, such as changing the compensation scheme, providing coaching, or organizing team-building activities (HBR, 2019).

## Case Study 4: "Everyday Power Dynamics and Hierarchies in Qualitative Research"

In their case study, Joosten et al. (2022) explore power dynamics and hierarchies in qualitative research. The study focuses on the role of humor in negotiating the stability of hierarchies in the field. By examining the researcher's multiple positionalities and the use of humor in ethnographic encounters, the authors shed light on the complexities of power dynamics within the research situation (Joosten et al., 2022).

## Case Study 5: "How Power Influences Moral Thinking"

Lammers and Stapel (2009) conducted a study to investigate how power influences moral thinking. Through a series of experiments, they found that individuals in high-power positions tend to make more utilitarian moral decisions, prioritizing overall outcomes over individual rights. This research highlights the potential for power to shape ethical decision-making processes (Lammers & Stapel, 2009).

## Analysis and Discussion

The compilation of these case studies provides valuable insights into the relationship between power dynamics and unethical considerations. The findings suggest that power differentials can significantly impact ethical decision-making processes within various contexts, including research teams, community-based participatory research, and organizational leadership.

In the case of authorship decisions in research teams, power dynamics can lead to unfair distribution of credit and authorship, potentially resulting in unethical practices. Early-career researchers may face challenges in navigating power differentials and advocating for their contributions (Cheruvelil et al., 2019).

Community-based participatory research also highlights the presence of power dynamics, with oppressive power exerted within communities and through the research enterprise. Recognizing and leveraging community strengths can help shift power dynamics towards more emancipatory approaches (Zhang & Wei, 2023).

Within organizational leadership, conflicts between leaders can create power struggles that affect team dynamics and overall organizational performance. Addressing such conflicts requires careful consideration of power dynamics and the implementation of strategies to foster collaboration and effective communication (HBR, 2019).

Qualitative research settings also demonstrate the complexities of power dynamics, with researchers negotiating their positionalities and hierarchies in the field. The use of humor can serve as a tool to navigate power dynamics and maintain stability within research situations (Joosten et al., 2022).

Furthermore, studies examining the influence of power on moral thinking reveal that individuals in high-power positions may prioritize overall outcomes over individual rights. This suggests that power can shape ethical decision-making processes, potentially leading to unethical behavior (Lammers & Stapel, 2009).

## Conclusion

The compilation of case studies on power dynamics with unethical considerations provides valuable insights into the complexities of power differentials and their impact on ethical decision-making. These case studies highlight the need for further research and professional discussions to better understand the relationship between power dynamics and ethical behavior.

Understanding the nuances of power dynamics can help organizations and individuals develop strategies to mitigate unethical practices and promote fairness and justice. By fostering open dialogue, providing training, and implementing policies that address power differentials, organizations can create environments that support ethical decision-making.

It is important to note that the case studies presented in this report provide a snapshot of the research conducted in this field. Further research is needed to explore the causal relationships between power perceptions and actual ethical behavior. Additionally, more empirical studies are required to determine which power perspectives and themes are more ethical than others.
