# The Evolving Concept of Social Capital in Digital Age Hierarchies

## Introduction

In the digital age, the concept of social capital has undergone significant evolution. With the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into our everyday lives, the study of online social capital has gained prominence. Online platforms have become a focal point for obtaining and reproducing social capital, leading to new forms of communication and network closure. This report aims to explore the evolving concept of social capital in digital age hierarchies, examining its implications and potential effects on society.

## Online Social Capital in the Digital Age

The integration of ICT into our lives has transformed the way we connect and interact with others. Online social capital refers to the resources embedded in social relations accessed and used by individuals through digital technologies. It encompasses the connections, networks, and trust that individuals build and maintain in online spaces. The blurring gap between offline and online social capital has become a key area of research, as individuals increasingly rely on digital platforms for social interaction and resource accumulation [1].

The use of new platforms, such as social media, has become a central focus in the study of online social capital. These platforms provide opportunities for individuals to accumulate and increase their social capital resources. Research has shown that social media users are exposed to multiple channels of influence within a highly fluid and complex communication agora. However, certain viewpoints may be avoided, leading to the formation of ideological cyberghettoes [2].

## Political Participation in the Digital Age

The digital age has also had a significant impact on political participation. Social media platforms have become important spaces for political engagement and mobilization. Studies have shown that social media social capital plays a crucial role in triggering traditional (offline) social capital, rather than the other way around. Social media social capital has been found to be a consistently stronger explanatory factor for political participation, regardless of the environment (offline or online) or circumstance (voting or not voting) [3].

However, the digital age also presents challenges for political participation. The fast-paced and febrile online environment may limit the share of voice for certain forms of organizations. Additionally, the speed of technological and cultural innovations poses a challenge to understanding new patterns of engagement and participation [2].

## Digital Cultural and Social Capital

The digital divide and its impact on social stratification have been subjects of theoretical debate. Digital cultural and social capital largely reflect individuals' socioeconomic backgrounds. While digital technologies offer opportunities for individuals to develop and navigate online resources, the ability to enhance one's own capital is influenced by socioeconomic factors. Individuals with higher social status tend to obtain more benefits from the internet and make better use of digital environments, potentially exacerbating existing offline inequalities [4].

Digital cultural capital is considered an essential condition for the development of digital social capital. It encompasses the embodied and objectified cultural capital critical for engaging in capital-enhancing activities in the digital space. The development of social connections and collective identities through the use of digital technologies helps individuals accumulate the cultural resources needed for capital-enhancing activities and healthy values and attitudes toward digital technologies and skills [5].

## Digital Social Capital and the Digital Divide

The concept of digital social capital extends beyond geographical boundaries and has global implications. Digital technologies provide opportunities for individuals to maintain and extend their social connections beyond offline circles and access information globally. Digital social capital can be defined as "the resources embedded in social relations accessed and used by individuals through digital technologies in intended actions." It plays a crucial role in understanding the effects of the digital divide on student development and the integration of resources across online and offline spaces [6].

However, it is important to note that the application of social capital theory to digital contexts should be approached with caution. Dominant groups in society may apply arbitrary criteria that reward specific uses of digital technology, potentially reinforcing existing social inequalities. Students from lower social classes may exercise agency to incorporate the digital space as an additional resource into their traditional funds of knowledge, enabling them to benefit maximally from digital technology [7].

## Reputation as Social Capital in the Digital Age

In the digital age, reputation has emerged as a form of social capital that holds significant value in the job market and professional networks. Reputation is considered the equivalent shared by both offline and online domains, serving as an asset that digital knowledge workers must acquire and strategically manage. It establishes trust among participants in hybrid contexts of interaction, comprising both digital and non-digital exchanges [8].

Reputation is closely linked to value as an investment in social relations, with the expectation of economic returns. It plays a crucial role in establishing trust and credibility in online environments. Reputation systems, such as online reviews and ratings, have become important mechanisms for managing online communities and evaluating creative practices [9].

## Conclusion

The concept of social capital has evolved significantly in the digital age. The integration of ICT into our everyday lives has transformed the way we connect, interact, and accumulate social capital resources. Online platforms, such as social media, have become central to the study of online social capital, providing opportunities for individuals to build networks and engage in political participation.

However, the digital age also presents challenges, such as the formation of ideological cyberghettoes and the perpetuation of existing social inequalities. The development of digital cultural and social capital plays a crucial role in understanding the effects of the digital divide and the integration of resources across online and offline spaces.

Reputation has emerged as a form of social capital in the digital age, holding significant value in professional networks and the job market. Reputation systems have become important mechanisms for managing online communities and evaluating creative practices.

Overall, the evolving concept of social capital in digital age hierarchies has profound implications for society. It is essential to continue studying and understanding these dynamics to ensure that the benefits of digital technologies are accessible to all and do not perpetuate existing inequalities.
