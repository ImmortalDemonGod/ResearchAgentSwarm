# Unethical Considerations in the Exercise of Power

## Introduction

The exercise of power is a fundamental aspect of human society, present in various domains such as politics, business, and leadership. Power can be defined as the ability to influence or control the behavior of others, and it often comes with a range of ethical considerations. This report aims to explore the unethical considerations in the exercise of power, drawing insights from various sources and case studies.

## Unethical Behavior and Power

Power has the potential to corrupt individuals and lead to unethical behavior. Lord Acton famously wrote, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." This statement highlights the inherent risk associated with the exercise of power. Numerous studies and real-world examples support Acton's assertion.

### The Wells Fargo Account Fraud Scandal

One notable example of unethical behavior and abuse of power is the Wells Fargo account fraud scandal. In this case, employees at Wells Fargo created millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts in order to meet aggressive sales targets. The unethical behavior was driven by the pressure exerted by the leadership to achieve unrealistic goals. The leaders failed to transfer proper ethical values to the workforce, resulting in fraudulent practices and a breach of trust with customers.

### Coercive Power and Unethical Practices

Coercive power, which involves ruling by fear and intimidation, has been historically used to achieve negative outcomes. In the corporate realm, coercive power can lead to unethical practices such as cutting corners or inflating earnings. When the ethics and morals of company leaders do not align with the organization, negative outcomes are more likely to occur. This highlights the importance of ethical leadership and the need for leaders to set the right example for their employees.

### The Stanford Prison Experiment

The Stanford Prison Experiment conducted by Phillip Zimbardo in 1971 provides further evidence of the corrupting effects of power. In this study, participants were randomly assigned the roles of guards and prisoners in a simulated prison environment. The guards quickly began to abuse their power, engaging in psychologically harmful behavior towards the prisoners. The study demonstrated how the mere presence of power can lead individuals to engage in unethical behavior.

### Power and Sexual Harassment

Research has also shown a link between power and an increased likelihood of engaging in sexual harassment. A study by Williams (2017) found that a sudden increase in power can make a person more likely to engage in sexual harassment. This highlights the importance of addressing power dynamics and promoting a culture of respect and equality in organizations.

## Ethical Use of Power

While power can have negative consequences, it is important to recognize that not all uses of power are unethical. Managers and leaders have the opportunity to exercise power in ways that align with ethical standards and promote positive outcomes.

### Guidelines for Ethical Use of Power

Several guidelines can be identified for the ethical use of power. Managers can verify subordinate compliance with work directives, ensure that requests are ethical and reasonable, offer rewards that are valued by employees, and administer punishments fairly and uniformly (OpenStax, 2020). By following these guidelines, managers can ensure that their exercise of power does not compromise ethical standards.

### Building an Ethical Culture

Creating an ethical culture within an organization is crucial for preventing unethical behavior and abuse of power. This involves setting clear ethical standards, promoting transparency and accountability, and fostering a culture of integrity. Leaders play a key role in shaping the ethical culture of an organization through their actions and behaviors.

### Holding Leaders Accountable

To prevent abuses of power, it is essential to hold leaders accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through mechanisms such as oversight from boards of directors, independent audits, and whistleblower protection. By establishing strong checks and balances, organizations can mitigate the risk of unethical behavior and ensure that leaders are held responsible for their actions.

## Conclusion

The exercise of power carries inherent ethical considerations, and there are numerous examples of power leading to unethical behavior. The Wells Fargo account fraud scandal, the Stanford Prison Experiment, and the link between power and sexual harassment all highlight the potential for power to corrupt individuals and lead to negative outcomes. However, it is important to recognize that not all uses of power are unethical. By following guidelines for ethical use of power, building an ethical culture, and holding leaders accountable, organizations can mitigate the risk of unethical behavior and promote positive outcomes.
