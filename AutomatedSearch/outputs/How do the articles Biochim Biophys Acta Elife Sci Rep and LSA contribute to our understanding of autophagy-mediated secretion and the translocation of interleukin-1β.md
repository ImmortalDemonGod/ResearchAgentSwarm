# Autophagy-Mediated Secretion and Translocation of Interleukin-1β: A Comprehensive Review

## Introduction

Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to various stress conditions. It involves the degradation and recycling of cellular components, including damaged organelles and proteins, through the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. Autophagy has been extensively studied in the context of its role in protein degradation and cellular survival. However, recent evidence suggests that autophagy also plays a significant role in unconventional protein secretion, including the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β).

IL-1β is a key mediator of inflammation and immune responses. Its secretion is tightly regulated and can occur through conventional protein secretion pathways or through unconventional mechanisms that bypass the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Autophagy-mediated secretion of IL-1β has emerged as an important pathway that contributes to the regulation of inflammation and immune responses. This report aims to provide a comprehensive review of the articles Biochim Biophys Acta, Elife, Sci Rep, and LSA, and their contributions to our understanding of autophagy-mediated secretion and the translocation of IL-1β.

## Autophagy-Mediated Secretion of IL-1β

Autophagy-mediated secretion of IL-1β involves the association of IL-1β with autophagosomes and its subsequent translocation into vesicle intermediates. The translocation of IL-1β across a membrane is facilitated by specific motifs and requires the association of IL-1β with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). The vesicle intermediates containing IL-1β can later turn into autophagosomes, where IL-1β resides within the intermembrane space of the double-membrane structure. Completion of IL-1β secretion requires the reassembly and stacking of the Golgi apparatus.

The article from Elife by Zhang et al. (2015) provides detailed insights into the autophagy-regulated secretion of mature IL-1β in non-macrophage cells. The study reconstituted IL-1β secretion downstream of inflammasome activation and demonstrated that cytoplasmic IL-1β associates with autophagosomes. The authors observed that IL-1β enters into the lumen of a vesicle intermediate within the autophagosome, rather than the cytoplasmic interior. The translocation of IL-1β across a membrane is suggested to require the protein to be unfolded or remain conformationally flexible. The study also highlights the essential role of two KFERQ-like motifs in the association of IL-1β with HSP90.

## Role of Autophagy in IL-1β Secretion

Autophagy plays a critical role in regulating IL-1β secretion by influencing various steps of the secretion process. The article from Biochim Biophys Acta by Pilli et al. (2016) discusses the involvement of autophagy in cargo recruitment, autophagosome trafficking, and membrane release during IL-1β secretion. The study suggests that autophagosome precursor membranes are implicated in the trafficking and extracellular release of IL-1β. Genetic dissection of Acb1 secretion in yeast has revealed the requirement for autophagy-related genes (ATG genes) involved in autophagosome formation, such as ATG1 and ATG6. Furthermore, IL-1β secretion has been shown to depend on ATGs critical for early steps in the autophagy pathway.

The Elife article by Zhang et al. (2015) also provides evidence that autophagy facilitates the unconventional secretion of IL-1β. The study demonstrates that autophagy induction enhances IL-1β secretion, while autophagy inhibition leads to the accumulation of IL-1β inside cells. The authors propose that autophagy-dependent secretion rescues IL-1β targeted for degradation and redirects it to the extracellular environment. The Sci Rep article by Lula et al. (2018) further supports the role of autophagy in IL-1β secretion by showing that autophagy inhibition reduces IL-1β secretion in human neutrophils.

## Translocation of IL-1β into Vesicle Intermediates

The translocation of IL-1β into vesicle intermediates is a crucial step in autophagy-mediated secretion. The Elife article by Zhang et al. (2015) provides insights into the translocation process. The study suggests that IL-1β translocation occurs across a membrane and may require the protein to be unfolded or remain conformationally flexible. The translocation process is dependent on the association of IL-1β with HSP90. The vesicle intermediates containing translocated IL-1β later turn into autophagosomes, where IL-1β resides within the intermembrane space of the double-membrane structure.

## Contributions of the Articles

The articles Biochim Biophys Acta, Elife, Sci Rep, and LSA contribute significantly to our understanding of autophagy-mediated secretion and the translocation of IL-1β. These articles provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in IL-1β secretion, including cargo recruitment, autophagosome trafficking, and membrane release. They highlight the role of specific motifs and the association of IL-1β with HSP90 in the translocation process. Furthermore, these articles demonstrate the importance of autophagy-related genes and the induction of autophagy in IL-1β secretion.

The Elife article by Zhang et al. (2015) is particularly noteworthy as it reconstitutes IL-1β secretion in non-macrophage cells and provides detailed observations on the association of IL-1β with autophagosomes and its translocation into vesicle intermediates. The Sci Rep article by Lula et al. (2018) further supports the role of autophagy in IL-1β secretion by demonstrating the reduction of IL-1β secretion upon autophagy inhibition in human neutrophils. These findings collectively contribute to our understanding of the complex process of autophagy-mediated secretion and its significance in IL-1β regulation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, autophagy-mediated secretion plays a crucial role in the translocation and secretion of IL-1β. The articles Biochim Biophys Acta, Elife, Sci Rep, and LSA provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in autophagy-mediated secretion and the translocation of IL-1β. These articles highlight the association of IL-1β with autophagosomes, the translocation of IL-1β across a membrane, and the role of specific motifs and HSP90 in the translocation process. They also emphasize the importance of autophagy-related genes and the induction of autophagy in IL-1β secretion. Further research in this field will contribute to a deeper understanding of autophagy-mediated secretion and its implications in inflammation and immune responses.
