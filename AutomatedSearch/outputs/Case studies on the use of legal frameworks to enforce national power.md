# Report: Case Studies on the Use of Legal Frameworks to Enforce National Power

## Introduction

Legal frameworks play a crucial role in enforcing national power by establishing processes, institutions, and regulations that guide decision-making and ensure compliance with national laws and policies. This report aims to provide case studies on the use of legal frameworks to enforce national power, highlighting their effectiveness and impact. The report will analyze various sources to present comprehensive insights into the application of legal frameworks in different contexts.

## Case Study 1: Private Law Dispute Resolution in Global Health Governance

One case study that demonstrates the use of legal frameworks to enforce national power is in the field of global health governance. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework provides an example of how private law dispute resolution can be used to strengthen compliance with non-binding international agreements [^1]. Under the PIP Framework, parties can enter into private contracts that are binding, thereby enhancing compliance with the framework's provisions.

Private law dispute resolution allows parties to seek legal remedies and enforce compliance with international rules. This approach addresses the challenge of weak enforcement mechanisms in international law, which often lacks the ability to effectively enforce obligations related to human rights, climate change, or arms control [^1]. By utilizing private contracts, parties can strengthen compliance with international health regulations, ultimately enhancing the governance of global health.

Case Study 2: Fragmented Institutional Mandates in Tobacco Control

Another case study that highlights the use of legal frameworks to enforce national power is in the context of tobacco control. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) exemplifies the "soft law" approach, which sets broad goals for national action while minimizing binding rules in favor of deliberation and flexibility [^2]. The FCTC relies on legal frameworks to address the challenge of fragmented institutional mandates.

In the case of tobacco control, parties engage in forum shopping, choosing the venue based on the desired outcome, leading to inconsistent standards [^2]. For example, tobacco giant Philip Morris reorganized its corporate structure to use the most favorable investment treaty to challenge Australia's plain packaging legislation [^2]. Additionally, the tobacco industry allegedly funded certain World Trade Organization (WTO) member states to access the WTO dispute resolution system and challenge Australia's plain packaging law [^2].

These examples demonstrate how legal frameworks can be used strategically to navigate fragmented institutional mandates and enforce national power. By leveraging different legal avenues, parties can seek favorable outcomes and challenge regulations that may impede their interests.

Case Study 3: Legal Mechanisms for Public Health Regulation

The use of legal frameworks to enforce national power is also evident in the field of public health regulation. Legal mechanisms and institutions are employed to define and delineate the scope of national health priorities and establish processes for transparent decision-making [^3]. These mechanisms play a crucial role in determining what is covered by national health policies and what is not.

One example of a legal mechanism is the establishment of independent statutory authorities tasked with reviewing clinical and epidemiological evidence and providing advice to governments on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments and technologies [^3]. Administrative agencies are also responsible for determining which medications are placed on formularies and the extent of government subsidies [^3]. Legislation can further specify the services or categories of services that should be provided under universal health coverage [^3].

These legal mechanisms and institutions enable governments to enforce national power by setting priorities, allocating resources, and regulating the provision of healthcare services. They provide a framework for decision-making and ensure that national health objectives are met.

## Analysis and Effectiveness of Legal Frameworks in Enforcing National Power

The case studies presented above demonstrate the diverse applications of legal frameworks in enforcing national power. Private law dispute resolution, as seen in global health governance, allows parties to strengthen compliance with non-binding international agreements. This approach enhances the governance of global health by providing a mechanism for enforcing obligations.

In the context of fragmented institutional mandates, legal frameworks enable parties to navigate inconsistent standards and challenge regulations that may impede their interests. The use of different legal avenues, such as investment treaties and dispute resolution systems, allows parties to strategically enforce their national power.

Legal mechanisms for public health regulation play a crucial role in defining national health priorities and ensuring transparent decision-making. By establishing independent statutory authorities, administrative agencies, and legislation, governments can enforce their power in determining healthcare coverage and resource allocation.

However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of legal frameworks in enforcing national power can vary depending on various factors. The enforcement of international law, for example, faces challenges due to the fragmented nature of the international legal system and the lack of strong enforcement mechanisms [^6]. While legal frameworks provide a framework for enforcement, their effectiveness ultimately depends on the willingness of parties to comply and the availability of resources for enforcement.

## Conclusion

Legal frameworks are essential tools for enforcing national power. The case studies presented in this report demonstrate the diverse applications of legal frameworks in different contexts, including global health governance, tobacco control, and public health regulation. These case studies highlight the effectiveness of legal frameworks in strengthening compliance with international rules, navigating fragmented institutional mandates, and defining national health priorities.

While legal frameworks provide a framework for enforcement, their effectiveness depends on various factors, including the willingness of parties to comply and the availability of resources for enforcement. As the global landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial to continually assess and adapt legal frameworks to ensure their effectiveness in enforcing national power.
