# Workshops or Courses on Setting Up Priors for Bayesian Analysis in Healthcare Applications

## Introduction

Bayesian analysis is an increasingly popular statistical approach used in various fields, including healthcare research. It provides a framework for incorporating prior knowledge and beliefs into the analysis, allowing for more informed decision-making. One crucial aspect of Bayesian analysis is setting up appropriate prior distributions, which reflect the researcher's prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameters of interest. To help researchers and practitioners in healthcare applications understand and effectively set up priors for Bayesian analysis, several workshops and courses are available. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these workshops and courses, their content, and their relevance in healthcare research.

## 1. Workshop on Bayesian Inference: Priors and Workflow

The Workshop on Bayesian Inference: Priors and Workflow, conducted by Riccardo Fusaroli and Chris Cox, offers a step-by-step approach to Bayesian analysis, focusing on setting up rigorous workflows and defining and assessing priors. The workshop assumes a minimal statistical literacy and is specifically designed for researchers who are curious about Bayesian analysis and concerned about setting priors and other subjective choices in their analyses. The workshop provides video lectures and exercises, showcasing a Bayesian workflow for a concrete analysis. It covers topics such as modeling outcomes, introducing predictors, acknowledging repeated measures, and incorporating previous findings.

The workshop materials, including video lectures and step-by-step commented scripts, are available on the workshop's website [^1^]. The instructors recommend watching the introductory videos before starting with the full content on Bayesian data analysis [^2^]. The workshop utilizes R, RStudio, Brms, and Stan for implementing the Bayesian models.

This workshop provides valuable guidance on setting up priors and conducting Bayesian analysis in healthcare applications. By following the step-by-step approach and working through the provided materials, researchers can gain a better understanding of Bayesian workflows and effectively incorporate prior knowledge into their analyses.

## 2. Workshop on Bayesian Hypothesis Testing: A Hybrid JASP Workshop

The Workshop on Bayesian Hypothesis Testing: A Hybrid JASP Workshop, organized by the University of Amsterdam, focuses on familiarizing participants with key Bayesian concepts in hypothesis testing. The workshop uses JASP, a program with an attractive graphical user interface that allows researchers to focus on core Bayesian concepts and principles. Concrete examples are provided to illustrate how to compute, report, and interpret Bayesian hypothesis tests for popular statistical models such as correlation, regression, t-test, ANOVA, and contingency tables. The workshop is relevant to researchers in various fields, including psychology, economics, biology, and any student or researcher who wishes to draw conclusions from empirical data. No background in Bayesian statistics is required to attend the workshop [^3^].

This workshop provides a practical introduction to Bayesian hypothesis testing and equips researchers with the necessary skills to apply Bayesian analysis in their healthcare research. By using JASP, participants can easily implement Bayesian hypothesis tests and gain insights into the interpretation of results.

## 3. Bayesian Modeling for Environmental Health Workshop

The Bayesian Modeling for Environmental Health Workshop, offered by the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, provides a comprehensive overview of Bayesian inference and modeling in the context of environmental health. The workshop aims to be approachable and friendly while still providing technical and practical know-how. It integrates seminar lectures with hands-on computer sessions to put concepts into practice. The workshop covers topics such as Bayesian workflows, temporal models, spatial models, non-parametric models, and the analysis of different data structures. Participants will gain familiarity with various software options, different types of analyses, and current and future research in Bayesian modeling for environmental health [^4^].

This workshop is particularly relevant for researchers and practitioners in the field of environmental health who are interested in incorporating Bayesian methods into their analyses. By attending this workshop, participants can gain a deeper understanding of Bayesian modeling techniques and their applications in environmental health research.

## 4. Bayesian Adaptive Trials Workshop

The Bayesian Adaptive Trials Workshop, offered by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, focuses on Bayesian adaptive designs for clinical trials. The workshop provides training on constructing Bayesian adaptive designs, examining their operating characteristics, and understanding the benefits and costs of interim analyses within the regulatory framework. Participants will develop skills in adaptive designs, Bayesian analysis, and Bayesian computation. The workshop is suitable for individuals with some knowledge of clinical trials and statistics [^5^].

This workshop is highly relevant for researchers and practitioners involved in clinical trial design and analysis. By gaining expertise in Bayesian adaptive designs, participants can enhance their ability to design efficient and informative clinical trials in healthcare research.

## Conclusion

Workshops and courses on setting up priors for Bayesian analysis in healthcare applications offer valuable training and guidance for researchers and practitioners. These educational opportunities provide a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian analysis, focusing on the crucial step of setting up appropriate prior distributions. By attending these workshops and courses, participants can gain practical skills in Bayesian modeling, hypothesis testing, and adaptive trial design. These skills are essential for conducting rigorous and informed analyses in healthcare research.

It is important for researchers and practitioners in healthcare to stay updated with the latest developments in Bayesian analysis and to continuously enhance their knowledge and skills in this area. The workshops and courses mentioned in this report provide excellent opportunities for individuals to expand their understanding of Bayesian analysis and its applications in healthcare.
