# The Development and Use of Cultural Power in Shaping Global Preferences

## Introduction

In today's interconnected world, the development and use of cultural power have become increasingly significant in shaping global preferences. Cultural power refers to the ability of a nation, organization, or individual to influence others through the dissemination of its cultural values, ideas, and practices. It encompasses various aspects such as cultural imperialism, soft power, cultural diplomacy, and the influence of media and popular culture. This report aims to explore the role of cultural power in shaping global preferences, examining its impact on developing economies, international relations, and the promotion of sustainable development.

## Cultural Power and Soft Power

Cultural power is closely related to the concept of soft power, which was coined by Joseph Nye in the late 1980s. Soft power refers to the ability to shape the preferences of others through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion or force. It relies on the appeal of a nation's culture, political values, and policies to influence the behavior and decisions of other actors in the international arena.

Soft power has gained prominence in the context of a globalized world where traditional forms of power, such as military might or economic dominance, are increasingly seen as insufficient to achieve desired outcomes. Factors such as globalization, debates over identity and nationalism, and the rise of consumerist culture have made soft power more relevant and effective in shaping global preferences.

## Cultural Power and Developing Economies

Developing economies have recognized the potential of cultural power in promoting their interests and enhancing their global standing. One example is the case of Global Ibsen, a project that aims to promote the works of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen worldwide. By leveraging Ibsen's cultural legacy, Norway has been able to enhance its soft power and position itself as a cultural hub. This cultural resource has become part of Norwegian developmental goals, contributing to human resource development on a global scale.

The use of cultural power by developing economies is driven by the desire to assert their cultural distinctiveness, raise their international profile, and compete in the global market. By showcasing their cultural heritage, traditions, and values, these countries can attract attention, build relationships, and shape global preferences in their favor.

## Cultural Power and Cultural Diplomacy

Cultural power is closely intertwined with cultural diplomacy, which refers to the use of cultural resources and activities to foster understanding, cooperation, and goodwill between nations. Cultural diplomacy aims to promote a nation's cultural distinctiveness, enhance its image, and build relationships with other countries.

Governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and businesses are all using cultural power and cultural diplomacy to promote their interests and values on the global stage. For example, businesses like Coca-Cola and Alibaba have used their cultural resources to create positive perceptions of their brands and products, as well as to promote values such as happiness, friendship, and diversity. NGOs like Amnesty International and Greenpeace have also utilized cultural diplomacy to raise awareness about human rights and environmental issues.

Cultural diplomacy is not limited to governments and organizations. Individuals, artists, and cultural influencers also play a significant role in shaping global preferences through their creative works, performances, and social media presence. Their ability to connect with audiences across borders and influence public opinion contributes to the development and use of cultural power.

## Cultural Power and Media Influence

Media, particularly international media, plays a crucial role in the development and dissemination of cultural power. The cross-border flow of media content has been a subject of debate, with concerns about cultural imperialism and the globalizing influences of media from dominant economies, such as the United States. Studies have analyzed the effects of media use across cultures, linking the frequency and intensity of exposure to foreign media content with changes in knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, values, and behavior.

International media outlets, such as the BBC and CNN, have significant influence in shaping global perceptions and values. Western countries, in particular, have leveraged the power of these media houses to spread their values and influence the opinions of foreign publics. However, the impact of media on cultural preferences is not unidirectional. Local cultures and subcultures also shape media messages, reflecting their distinct cultural values and perspectives.

## Cultural Power and Sustainable Development

The role of cultural power in sustainable development has gained recognition in recent years. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been at the forefront of promoting culture as a fourth pillar of sustainable development. The paradigm shift in the heritage-development agenda has led to a more integrated approach, recognizing the interconnections between cultural heritage, social development, and environmental sustainability.

UNESCO has advocated for a pragmatic approach to heritage, engaging in the shaping of the United Nations' 2030 agenda. The organization has emphasized the importance of cultural diversity, intercultural dialogue, and the preservation of cultural heritage in achieving sustainable development goals. By leveraging cultural power and cultural diplomacy, UNESCO aims to foster peace, understanding, and cooperation among nations.

## Conclusion

The development and use of cultural power have become increasingly significant in shaping global preferences. Soft power, cultural diplomacy, and media influence all play crucial roles in this process. Developing economies, governments, NGOs, businesses, and individuals are leveraging cultural power to promote their interests, enhance their global standing, and shape international relations.

While cultural power offers opportunities for intercultural understanding, cooperation, and peacebuilding, it is not without challenges and criticisms. Concerns about cultural imperialism, propaganda, and the reinforcement of stereotypes have been raised. However, the potential of cultural power to shape global preferences and influence the actions of individuals, organizations, and nations cannot be ignored.

As the world continues to become more interconnected, the development and use of cultural power will likely remain a significant factor in shaping global relations and perceptions. The ability to attract and persuade others through cultural resources will continue to play a crucial role in the evolving dynamics of international relations and the pursuit of sustainable development.
