## Influence of Private Military Companies on National and International Power Dynamics

Private military companies (PMCs) have emerged as significant actors in contemporary conflicts, playing a role in shaping national and international power dynamics. PMCs are corporate entities that provide military and security services on behalf of states, non-state actors, NGOs, and private corporations. Their involvement in conflicts has raised concerns about accountability, human rights violations, and the impact on the protection of civilians. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the influence of PMCs on national and international power dynamics, drawing on various sources to present a balanced and informed perspective.

### The Localization of the Private Military Industry

The private military industry has undergone a transformation in recent years, with a shift towards localization. A U.S. Senate report highlighted the localization of the industry, noting that what were once warlord militias have now become private security companies. This transformation has been facilitated by American and British PMCs subcontracting local security companies, which have subsequently gone into business for themselves. However, this localization has raised concerns about the activities of these local subcontractors, as evidence has emerged linking them to murder, kidnapping, bribery, and anti-coalition activities.

### Role of PMSCs in Contemporary Conflicts

Contrary to popular perception influenced by pop culture, PMSCs are not simply cowboys or desperados. They are corporate entities acting on behalf of states or non-state actors, often providing logistics, support, and training rather than engaging in direct combat. While they may augment state forces, they do not replace them. However, there is a growing trend of PMSCs being used in combat roles by smaller states and non-state actors. The evolving nature of warfare and the increasing applications of PMSCs have significant consequences for contemporary conflicts.

### PMSCs and Multinational Corporations

Multinational corporations have become major clients of PMSCs, particularly in the extractive industries. Companies operating in dangerous areas are turning to private force due to a lack of trust in corrupt or inept security forces provided by host governments. For example, mining giant Freeport-McMoRan employed Triple Canopy to protect its mine in Papua, Indonesia, where there is an insurgency. This trend highlights the growing reliance on PMSCs by corporations to safeguard their assets in conflict zones.

### The Emerging Threat of PMSCs

The market for force has expanded, and PMSCs have become big business on a global scale. The exact size of this illicit market is unknown, but it is clear that business is booming. PMSCs have been involved in major conflicts in Yemen, Nigeria, Ukraine, Syria, and Iraq, often outclassing local militaries and even standing up to elite forces. The emergence of contemporary mercenaries, such as the Wagner Group, has gone largely unnoticed by scholars, the mainstream media, and the intelligence community. This lack of understanding poses a dangerous threat.

### Impact on the Protection of Civilians

The proliferation of PMCs in conflict-affected areas has raised concerns about violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws. Infamous incidents, such as the killing of civilians by Blackwater contractors in Nisour Square, Baghdad, have led to calls for better monitoring, regulation, and accountability of PMCs. The issue brief on privatizing war by Civilians in Conflict highlights the impact of PMCs on the protection of civilians, emphasizing the need for attribution and accountability for civilian harm caused by PMCs.

### Regulatory Challenges and Legal Ambiguities

The use of PMCs has raised significant regulatory challenges and legal ambiguities. The existing regulatory landscape for PMSCs operates in a legal gray area, with no universally accepted, legally binding, standard definition of a PMC. The lack of clear regulations and incongruent policies due to competing political and judicial systems have contributed to the ambiguity surrounding the industry. Efforts to regulate PMSCs have been hindered by their ability to cherry-pick guidelines and legislation, rendering existing regulatory tools ineffective.

### Influence on State Sovereignty and National Sacrifice

The use of PMCs by states has reshaped the concept of state sovereignty and the notion of national sacrifice. The adoption of PMCs alters the traditional relationship between citizen-soldiers and the nation, which serves as a source of national cohesion and a means of restraining state power. The reliance on PMCs raises questions about the ethical nature of their involvement in conflicts and the impact on the perception of national sacrifice.

### PMSCs and Conflict Severity

Scholarly research has explored the relationship between PMSCs and conflict severity. Studies have found that the presence of armed PMSCs is associated with increased conflict severity, even when controlling for previous conflict severity. PMSC interventions can substitute for or free up conventional forces, leading to an escalation of conflict. However, further research is needed to fully understand the complex dynamics between PMSCs and conflict severity.

### Conclusion

The influence of private military companies on national and international power dynamics is a complex and multifaceted issue. PMSCs have become significant actors in contemporary conflicts, providing military and security services on behalf of states, non-state actors, and corporations. Their localization, involvement in combat roles, and impact on the protection of civilians have raised concerns about accountability and human rights violations. The regulatory challenges and legal ambiguities surrounding PMSCs have further complicated efforts to monitor and regulate their activities. The use of PMCs has also reshaped the concept of state sovereignty and the perception of national sacrifice. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of PMSCs on national and international power dynamics.
