# Mechanisms for Accumulating Structural Power

## Introduction

Structural power refers to the ability of actors or entities to shape and influence the structures and dynamics of political, economic, and social systems. It goes beyond traditional notions of power that focus on direct coercion or control and instead emphasizes the ability to shape the rules, norms, and institutions that govern these systems. This report aims to identify and analyze the mechanisms through which structural power is accumulated. By examining various sources, including academic articles and journals, we will explore different perspectives and examples that shed light on the accumulation of structural power.

## The Concept of Structural Power

Before delving into the mechanisms for accumulating structural power, it is important to understand the concept itself. Susan Strange, a prominent scholar in the field, defines structural power as the ability to shape the structures of security, finance, production, and knowledge. It encompasses both intentional and unintended effects of decisions made by governments and other actors. Structural power is diffused through networks and institutions, influencing the functioning of the global political economy.

## Mechanisms for Accumulating Structural Power

### 1. Relational Power and Agenda Setting

One mechanism for accumulating structural power is through relational power and agenda setting. Stephen Krasner's concept of "meta-power" highlights how developing countries can use institutions and regimes to affect the rules of global liberalism. By participating in international organizations and shaping the agenda, these countries can influence the rules and norms that govern global politics. This mechanism allows them to accumulate structural power by shaping the structures and processes of the international system.

### 2. Dominance of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs)

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a significant role in accumulating structural power. They possess substantial power in trade, investment, and production, which allows them to dominate various sectors of the global economy. MNEs control research and development, finance, foreign direct investment (FDI), and trade. Their influence extends beyond economic realms, as they shape policies and negotiate trade agreements. MNEs' structural power arises from their ability to set the rules and dictate the terms of engagement in the global political economy.

### 3. Lobbying and Policy Influence

Large and productive firms, particularly MNEs, often engage in lobbying activities to influence policy outcomes. They leverage their economic power and resources to advocate for preferential trade agreements and shape legislation domestically and internationally. By exerting pressure on governments and policymakers, these firms accumulate structural power by shaping the rules and regulations that govern their industries. This mechanism highlights the interplay between economic power and political influence in the accumulation of structural power.

### 4. Security Power and Hegemony

Security power plays a crucial role in the accumulation of structural power. Powerful states, such as the United States, can leverage their security capabilities to shape the international system. Through alliances, military presence, and security guarantees, dominant states establish their hegemony and influence the behavior of other states. This mechanism allows them to shape the structures of security and exert control over global politics. The United States' relationship with Europe after World War II exemplifies how security power can contribute to the accumulation of structural power.

### 5. Diffusion of Power through Networks

Structural power can also be accumulated through the diffusion of power via networks. As power becomes increasingly transnational and non-territorially linked, it diffuses through various networks and institutions. This diffusion of power leads to the increasing interdependence and interconnectedness of actors in the global political economy. Governments, non-state actors, and international organizations contribute to the functioning of the global political economy, collectively shaping the structures and dynamics of power.

## Conclusion

The mechanisms for accumulating structural power are multifaceted and interconnected. Relational power, dominance of multinational enterprises, lobbying and policy influence, security power, and diffusion of power through networks all contribute to the accumulation of structural power. These mechanisms highlight the complex dynamics of power in the global political economy, where actors leverage their resources, capabilities, and influence to shape the structures and rules that govern international relations. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for comprehending power dynamics and their implications for global governance.
