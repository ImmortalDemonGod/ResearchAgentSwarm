# Environmental Power and Sustainability: Unethical Leadership

## Introduction

Unethical leadership has significant implications for environmental power and sustainability. The actions and decisions of leaders can shape the behavior and practices of organizations, influencing their environmental impact and commitment to sustainability. This report explores the relationship between unethical leadership and environmental sustainability, drawing on various scholarly articles and research studies. It examines the impact of unethical leadership on social sustainability, the role of ethical leadership in promoting pro-environmental behaviors, and the importance of environmental leadership in fostering sustainability. The report also discusses the need for ethical values and ethical climate in organizations to address sustainability challenges. 

## Unethical Leadership and Social Sustainability

Unethical leadership practices have a detrimental impact on social sustainability. Research has shown that unethical leaders can instigate unethical behaviors among followers, leading to negative consequences for organizations and society as a whole (Mitchell et al., 2022). Unethical leadership is characterized by behaviors and decisions that are not only anti-moral but often illegal, promoting a culture of misconduct and unethical behavior (Mitchell & Treviño, 2022). Examples of unethical leadership include deliberate acts of greed, lack of accountability, and conscious rule-breaking within organizations (Sims & Brinkmann, 2003).

The Volkswagen emissions scandal, also known as "Dieselgate," is a prominent example of the consequences of unethical leadership. The scandal, which cost the company an estimated $63 billion, resulted from a combination of unethical leaders and an unethical organizational culture (Javaid et al., 2020). Similar cases, such as the Enron scandal, highlight the role of unethical leadership in fostering an unethical climate that leads to reputational and financial damage (Sims & Brinkmann, 2003).

To address social sustainability challenges, organizations need leaders who are committed to ethical behavior and values. Ethical leadership promotes a positive organizational culture and fosters integrity, transparency, and accountability (Mitchell et al., 2022). By promoting ethical values and behaviors, leaders can contribute to the development of a positive organizational culture that supports social sustainability.

## Ethical Leadership and Pro-Environmental Behaviors

Ethical leadership plays a crucial role in promoting pro-environmental behaviors within organizations. Ethical leaders consider protecting the natural environment a moral obligation and demonstrate and promote pro-environmental behaviors to their followers (Wu et al., 2015). They act responsibly while interacting with employees, society, and the natural environment, fostering a sense of obligation toward the environment (Mitchell et al., 2022).

Research has shown that ethical leadership positively influences employees' ethical and pro-social behaviors and negatively affects unethical behaviors (Brown et al., 2005; Chughtai et al., 2015; Byun et al., 2018; Zhang and Tu, 2018; Moore et al., 2019). Ethical leaders establish ethical standards and encourage their subordinates to follow these standards, including environmental standards (Kalshoven and Den Hartog, 2009; Usman et al., 2018; Moore et al., 2019). They communicate the importance of ethical and pro-environmental behaviors, creating a culture that supports sustainability.

Drawing on social learning theory, ethical leaders serve as role models for their followers, who observe, learn from, and imitate their leaders' sense of obligation toward the natural environment (Bandura, 1977, 1986). This observation and learning process can lead followers to engage in discretionary behaviors that protect the natural environment, such as recycling and waste reduction (Mitchell et al., 2022).

## Environmental Leadership and Sustainability

Environmental leadership is a critical factor in promoting sustainability within organizations. It involves the development and execution of environmentally friendly practices to address ecological challenges (El-Kassar and Singh, 2019). Environmental leaders are fully committed to environmental ethics and integrate environmental practices into day-to-day activities to effectively address sustainability issues (El-Kassar and Singh, 2019; Singh and El-Kassar, 2019).

The role of environmental leadership in encouraging pro-organizational, pro-social, and pro-environmental behavior is well-documented (Lu et al., 2019). However, the efficacy and effectiveness of leaders' influences depend on other factors, such as followers' abilities and attitudes, organizational climate and culture, and situational factors (Mahmood et al., 2019). The integration of followers' values and the ethical climate of organizations is crucial for understanding the influence of ethical leaders on sustainable performance (Bouman et al., 2020).

Employees' biospheric values, which reflect their concern for the environment, have been identified as predictors of ecological behavior and can ultimately influence the sustainable performance of organizations (Bouman et al., 2020). When leaders' ethical norms align with the organizational ethical climate, they can strengthen employees' pro-environmental intention and future environment-supportive actions, thereby improving sustainable performance (Ateş, 2020).

## Ethical Values and Ethical Climate for Sustainability

Environmental sustainability is often considered a moral value, and environmental issues are seen as unethical in nature (Barnett et al., 2005). Achieving environmental sustainability requires ethical and pro-environmental behaviors from both leaders and employees (Barnett et al., 2005). Organizations need to foster an ethical climate that supports sustainability by promoting ethical values and behaviors.

Ethical climate refers to the shared perceptions of ethical practices and behaviors within an organization (Victor and Cullen, 1988). It influences employees' ethical decision-making and behavior, including their commitment to environmental sustainability (Mitchell et al., 2022). An ethical climate that emphasizes the importance of environmental standards and practices can shape employees' behavior and promote sustainability.

Research has shown that ethical leadership and ethical climate are positively related to employees' ethical and pro-social behaviors and negatively related to unethical behaviors (Brown et al., 2005; Chughtai et al., 2015; Byun et al., 2018; Zhang and Tu, 2018; Moore et al., 2019). By fostering an ethical climate and promoting ethical values, organizations can create an environment that supports sustainability and encourages pro-environmental behaviors.

## Conclusion

Unethical leadership poses significant challenges to environmental power and sustainability. The actions and decisions of leaders can have far-reaching consequences for organizations and society as a whole. Unethical leadership practices undermine social sustainability and contribute to a culture of misconduct and unethical behavior. On the other hand, ethical leadership plays a crucial role in promoting pro-environmental behaviors and fostering a positive organizational culture that supports sustainability.

To address sustainability challenges, organizations need leaders who are committed to ethical behavior and values. Ethical leaders consider protecting the natural environment a moral obligation and demonstrate and promote pro-environmental behaviors to their followers. They establish ethical standards, communicate the importance of ethical and pro-environmental behaviors, and serve as role models for their followers.

Environmental leadership is also essential for sustainability. It involves the development and execution of environmentally friendly practices and requires a holistic approach that integrates followers' values and the ethical climate of organizations. By aligning ethical norms with the organizational ethical climate, leaders can strengthen employees' pro-environmental intention and future environment-supportive actions, ultimately improving sustainable performance.

Creating an ethical climate that supports sustainability is crucial. Organizations need to promote ethical values and behaviors and emphasize the importance of environmental standards and practices. By fostering an ethical climate, organizations can shape employees' behavior and promote sustainability.

In conclusion, ethical leadership and ethical values are essential for addressing sustainability challenges and promoting environmental power. Organizations must prioritize ethical behavior and values to foster a culture of sustainability and ensure a positive impact on the environment and society.
