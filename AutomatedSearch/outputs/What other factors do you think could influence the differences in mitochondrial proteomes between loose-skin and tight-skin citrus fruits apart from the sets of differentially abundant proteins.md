# Factors Influencing Differences in Mitochondrial Proteomes between Loose-Skin and Tight-Skin Citrus Fruits

**Abstract**

Citrus fruits are known for their diverse flavors, aromas, and nutritional properties. The differences in the mitochondrial proteomes between loose-skin (easy to peel) and tight-skin (hard to peel) citrus fruits have been a subject of scientific investigation. This report aims to explore the factors that could influence these differences in mitochondrial proteomes. By analyzing the available research articles, we find that several factors contribute to the variations in mitochondrial proteomes, including genetic variations, postharvest practices, metabolic pathways, and environmental factors. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into the regulation of fruit quality maintenance and the metabolic processes occurring in citrus fruits.

**Introduction**

Citrus fruits, including satsuma mandarin, ponkan mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo, exhibit variations in their mitochondrial proteomes. The mitochondrial proteome refers to the complete set of proteins present in the mitochondria, which play crucial roles in energy metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and other cellular processes. Differences in the mitochondrial proteomes between loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits have been investigated to understand the underlying mechanisms that contribute to fruit quality maintenance and postharvest storage performance.

**Genetic Variations**

Genetic variations in mitochondrial genes can influence the composition and abundance of proteins in the mitochondrial proteome. Mitochondrial genetic variation can arise from mutations or polymorphisms in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These variations can affect mitochondrial function and contribute to differences in the mitochondrial proteomes between citrus fruit varieties.

A study by Li et al. (2021) analyzed the mitochondrial proteomes of four major citrus species: satsuma mandarin, ponkan mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo. They identified a total of 26,740 assigned peptides representing 3,755 nonredundant proteins. Among these proteins, 1,614 were commonly detected in all four species, accounting for 48.1% of all identified proteins. These proteins were significantly enriched in carbon metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation.

The presence of common proteins across different citrus species suggests the conservation of mitochondrial energy metabolism pathways. However, the study also identified differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits. These DAPs were mainly associated with fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, indicating differences in mitochondrial metabolism between the two types of citrus fruit.

**Postharvest Practices**

Postharvest practices, such as storage conditions and handling methods, can impact the mitochondrial proteomes of citrus fruits. Loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits undergo different postharvest practices due to their distinct peel characteristics. Understanding the effects of these practices on mitochondrial proteomes can provide insights into fruit quality maintenance and postharvest storage performance.

Li et al. (2021) optimized a protocol for the isolation of high-quality mitochondria from citrus pulp. They used satsuma mandarin, ponkan mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo to represent loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits, respectively. The mitochondrial proteomes of these fruits were characterized using a label-free liquid chromatography and two-dimensional mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based approach. The study identified DAPs involved in mitochondrial metabolism between the two types of species.

The results indicated that loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits have differences in mitochondrial metabolism, particularly in fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. These differences may be attributed to variations in postharvest practices, such as the handling and storage conditions specific to each type of citrus fruit.

**Metabolic Pathways**

Metabolic pathways play a crucial role in determining the composition and abundance of proteins in the mitochondrial proteome. The mitochondrial proteomes of citrus fruits are primarily involved in oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, and pyruvate metabolism. These pathways are essential for energy production and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

Li et al. (2021) found that proteins identified in all citrus species were mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, and pyruvate metabolism. This suggests that mitochondrial energy metabolism is conserved among different citrus fruits. However, the study also identified DAPs associated with fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, indicating differences in mitochondrial metabolism between loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits.

The differences in metabolic pathways between loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits may contribute to variations in the mitochondrial proteomes. These variations can affect the fruit quality maintenance and postharvest storage performance of citrus fruits.

**Environmental Factors**

Environmental factors, such as temperature, light, and nutrient availability, can influence the mitochondrial proteomes of citrus fruits. These factors can affect the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism and protein synthesis, leading to variations in the mitochondrial proteomes.

Li et al. (2021) characterized the mitochondrial proteomes of citrus fruits using a label-free LC-MS/MS-based approach. The study identified proteins involved in carbon metabolism, the TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. These metabolic pathways are influenced by environmental factors, such as nutrient availability and temperature.

Additionally, environmental factors can affect the ripening process of citrus fruits, which is closely associated with mitochondrial metabolism. Mitochondria play a crucial role in fruit ripening and senescence processes, including ethylene synthesis, respiration, and the defense response against postharvest pathogens (Li et al., 2021).

**Conclusion**

The differences in mitochondrial proteomes between loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits can be influenced by various factors, including genetic variations, postharvest practices, metabolic pathways, and environmental factors. Genetic variations in mitochondrial genes can contribute to differences in protein composition and abundance in the mitochondrial proteome. Postharvest practices, such as storage conditions and handling methods, can impact the mitochondrial proteomes of citrus fruits. Metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, and pyruvate metabolism, play a crucial role in determining the composition and abundance of proteins in the mitochondrial proteome. Environmental factors, such as temperature and nutrient availability, can also influence the mitochondrial proteomes of citrus fruits.

Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into the regulation of fruit quality maintenance and the metabolic processes occurring in citrus fruits. Further research is needed to explore the specific mechanisms underlying the differences in mitochondrial proteomes between loose-skin and tight-skin citrus fruits. This knowledge can contribute to the development of improved postharvest practices and the enhancement of fruit quality in the citrus industry.
