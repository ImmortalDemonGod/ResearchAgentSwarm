# Report: Innovative Policy Solutions that Enhanced Political Influence

## Introduction

In contemporary democracies, encouraging innovative solutions and new agendas has become a great public policy challenge. Governments are increasingly recognizing the importance of applying new technologies for social and economic improvement. However, the quality of policy system outputs should not be determined solely by novelty and innovation. It is crucial to ensure that social value is advanced, externalities are mitigated, and the benefits of past endeavors are protected, including good governance processes. This report aims to explore innovative policy solutions that have enhanced political influence, taking into account the need for institutional knowledge and experience.

## The Importance of Policy Innovation

Policy innovation is increasingly recommended as many traditional solutions are found to be ineffective. The quest for policy innovation is driven by the need to tackle social, economic, technological, and bio-health issues more effectively. Improved knowledge and understanding are required not only to appreciate and foster innovations but also to identify appropriate ways to regulate new technologies. Policy innovation is particularly relevant at the local level and in place-based contexts, where innovative solutions can be tailored to specific challenges. It is essential to consider the arguments in favor of social experimentation and co-design processes for addressing wicked problems. These approaches can lead to the development of novel and effective solutions that have a positive impact on society.

## Collaborative Policymaking and Political Leadership

Collaborative policymaking provides a potent tool for soliciting inputs, ideas, and resources that politicians need to create innovative and effective solutions. Many politicians are eager to strengthen their political leadership during hard times that call for innovative approaches. Collaborative policymaking allows politicians to seek inputs from relevant and affected actors, enhancing their understanding of the problems at hand and inspiring them to formulate new and better solutions. New forms of interactive political leadership are emerging, often supported by new institutional designs. For example, in Gentofte Municipality in Denmark, local councilors have reduced the time spent on case processing by involving citizens and stakeholder groups in the policymaking process.

## Balancing Institutional Knowledge and External Expertise

While policy innovation often involves seeking external expertise, it is crucial to balance institutional knowledge and experience. External actors, such as consultants, think tanks, and research centers, can provide valuable insights and ideas. However, their positioning outside the core operations of government departments may limit the impact or uptake of policy innovation ideas by government officials and leaders. To ensure successful implementation, it is essential for government officials and leaders to be closely involved in network steering processes. This involvement allows for the integration of institutional knowledge and experience, mitigating the risk of unintended effects on state capacities and public trust.

## Mechanisms and Impacts of Innovation Policy

Innovation policy plays a crucial role in job creation and economic growth, especially in young, high-growth firms. The private sector often underinvests in innovation, creating an opportunity for the public sector to step in. However, the effectiveness of innovation policy tools and programs varies. It is essential to design mechanisms that target the right projects and avoid subsidizing projects that would have gone forward without government involvement. Additionally, policy interventions should not solely support poor-quality projects that are likely to fail even with government support. To maximize the impact of innovation policy, it is necessary to carefully evaluate and select the most effective tools and programs.

## Influencing Policy Change through Evidence-Based Narratives

Evidence-based narratives play a crucial role in influencing policy change. Elite advisors and evidence producers can effectively use persuasion tactics, networking, and longevity strategies to counteract a volatile political context and competing policy priorities. Understanding the formal and informal aspects of the policymaking process, establishing common goals with diverse policy actors, and effectively communicating persuasive evidence-based narratives are key to achieving impact. Policymakers are more likely to be influenced by evidence when it is presented during windows of opportunity, such as critical junctures or changes in public mood or media narratives. Successful initiatives combine insider strategies, such as building relationships with policymakers and presenting evidence, with additional influencing strategies, such as capitalizing on windows of opportunity or outsider pressure.

## Enhancing Civic Space and Strengthening Civil Society Participation

Efforts to widen civic space and strengthen civil society participation have been successful in influencing policy change. In many cases, widening civic space has been linked to encouraging policy change on various issues, including health, gender equality, climate change, land rights, and poverty. However, insider influencing strategies, such as building relationships with policymakers and presenting evidence, are necessary but not sufficient conditions for influencing policy. Successful initiatives combine insider strategies with capitalizing on windows of opportunity or outsider pressure. The supply of evidence is important, but it is only one part of the story. To promote the uptake of research evidence in policy, it is crucial to understand policymaking processes, design evidence to maximize its influence, and adapt the presentation of evidence and influencing strategies to the changing context.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Policy Development

Improving policy development capacity under conditions of risk and uncertainty requires collaborative and networked approaches to policy deliberation. Collaborative policymaking and innovation and experimentation processes offer great potential for developing novel and effective solutions. However, challenges exist in terms of balancing the need for innovation with the preservation of institutional knowledge and experience. Policymakers must navigate the difficult balancing act between the old and the new, ensuring that policy innovation is grounded in evidence and takes into account the potential unintended effects on state capacities and public trust. Embracing trial and error and learning from past experiences can help policymakers address wicked problems and navigate the contemporary politics of populism and opinion-based policy ideas.

## Conclusion

Innovative policy solutions have the potential to enhance political influence by addressing complex challenges and fostering social, economic, and technological improvements. Collaborative policymaking, the integration of external expertise, and the use of evidence-based narratives are key strategies for achieving policy change. Balancing institutional knowledge and external expertise is crucial to ensure successful implementation and mitigate unintended effects. However, challenges exist in terms of navigating the tension between innovation and the preservation of institutional knowledge and experience. Policymakers must carefully consider the context, engage with diverse stakeholders, and adapt their approaches to maximize the impact of policy innovation.
