4. Software updates: CrysAlisPro is continually updated with new features and bug fixes. Beta-test versions of the software are used by Agilent Technologies employees, and stable releases are made available for customer use approximately every six months. Users can download the latest releases from the XRD forum.

## Crystal Structure Visualization in CrysAlisPro

CrysAlisPro provides several tools and functionalities for visualizing crystal structures. These tools allow users to explore the crystal lattice, analyze symmetry, and visualize the atomic arrangement. Here are some of the key visualization features:

1. Crystal card: The Crystal card in CrysAlisPro displays the current unit cell information, sample chemical formula, Z value, and machine model parameters. It also provides an average unit cell from Proffit, which is CrysAlisPro's cell refinement and interpretation tool.

2. Ewald Explorer: The Ewald Explorer tool in CrysAlisPro allows users to visualize the reciprocal lattice and explore diffraction patterns. It provides options to rotate, zoom, and analyze the diffraction data.

3. Crystal tab: The Crystal tab in CrysAlisPro allows users to control the lattice parameters. It provides options to re-index peaks, carry out lattice transformations, and search for twinned and incommensurate samples. The distribution histograms in this tab provide a visual plot for determining the quality of indexation.

4. AutoChem: CrysAlisPro integrates with the AutoChem software, which is used for the refinement and interpretation of difficult crystal structures, especially modulated structures. AutoChem is developed at the Institute of Physics in Prague and is considered the industry standard for working with incommensurate/modulated structure data sets.

## Data Collection for Protein Crystallography

CrysAlisPro also offers specific features and tools for data collection and analysis in protein crystallography. These features are designed to streamline the process of collecting and analyzing X-ray diffraction data from protein crystals. Here are some key aspects of data collection for protein crystallography in CrysAlisPro:

1. Peaks, Unit Cell, and Quality: CrysAlisPro provides three sections for analyzing peaks, unit cell parameters, and data quality. The Peaks section shows the percentage of found peaks or spots that fit the unit cell. Users can adjust the peak search parameters to optimize the peak search for difficult samples.

2. Crystal Screening: CrysAlisPro includes a crystal screening function that allows users to test multiple crystals in succession. This feature is particularly useful for screening a large number of crystals to identify suitable candidates for further analysis.

3. Data Processing and Scaling: CrysAlisPro automatically processes the collected data and attempts to solve and refine the crystal structure using the Olex2 software. The software evaluates the resolution, space group, and other parameters to generate a refined crystal structure.

## Freely Available Crystal Structure Visualization Software

Apart from CrysAlisPro, there are several other freely available software tools for visualizing crystal structures. These tools offer different features and functionalities for crystal structure visualization. Here are some notable examples:
