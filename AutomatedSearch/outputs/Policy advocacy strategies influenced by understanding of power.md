# Policy Advocacy Strategies Influenced by Understanding of Power

## Introduction

Policy advocacy is a crucial tool for influencing policy change and addressing societal issues. However, the effectiveness of advocacy strategies is greatly influenced by an understanding of power dynamics. Power dynamics play a significant role in shaping the policy-making process and determining the success or failure of advocacy efforts. This report aims to explore the various aspects of policy advocacy strategies influenced by an understanding of power, including the strategies deployed, community engagement, target selection, outcomes achieved, and the growth of power over time.

## Strategies and Tactics Deployed

Advocacy strategies and tactics are essential components of any advocacy campaign. The choice of strategies and tactics can greatly impact the effectiveness of advocacy efforts. According to the Evaluation Innovation report, there are different approaches to advocacy based on the understanding of power dynamics:

1. Advocacy Based on Organizing: This approach prioritizes building power through organizing and mobilizing impacted communities. It recognizes the role of an authentic organized base as the primary driver of change. The strategy focuses on leadership development and building power in a defined area.

2. Advocacy Based on Pundits and Influentials: This approach mobilizes pundits, policy entrepreneurs, and other influential individuals as the drivers of change. It relies on their expertise and connections to advocate for policy change.

3. Advocacy Based on Shared Analysis: This approach emphasizes a shared analysis of root causes and inequities. It aims to develop strategies grounded in a deep understanding of the underlying issues and power dynamics.

4. Advocacy Based on Authentic Community Engagement: This approach centers impacted communities and their narratives. It challenges dominant frames and amplifies the voices of those directly affected by the policies in question.

The choice of strategy depends on the specific context, goals, and resources available to advocacy organizations. Each approach has its strengths and limitations, and a combination of strategies may be employed to achieve the desired outcomes.

## Community Engagement

Community engagement is a critical aspect of effective advocacy strategies. Engaging impacted communities ensures that their voices are heard and their needs are addressed. The Evaluation Innovation report highlights the importance of community engagement in advocacy efforts. It examines how communities were engaged in the advocacy process and the extent to which their input influenced the strategies deployed.

Advocacy strategies that prioritize building power often involve community-driven narratives and storytelling. Impacted communities drive the narratives, challenging dominant frames and shaping the discourse around the issues they face. This approach empowers communities to tell their own stories and advocate for their needs.

On the other hand, advocacy strategies that prioritize achieving a "win" may engage communities to support a predetermined policy agenda. In these cases, community engagement may be more focused on mobilizing support rather than actively involving communities in shaping the advocacy strategies.

The level of community engagement can vary depending on the approach taken. Advocacy based on organizing places a strong emphasis on building the power and influence of impacted communities. This approach involves ongoing engagement and leadership development within the community. In contrast, advocacy based on pundits and influentials may have limited community engagement, with the focus on leveraging the expertise and connections of influential individuals.

## Target Selection

Target selection is a crucial aspect of advocacy strategies. Identifying the right targets for advocacy efforts can significantly impact the likelihood of policy change. The Evaluation Innovation report examines who was targeted with advocacy and how target selection influenced the outcomes achieved.

Advocacy strategies influenced by an understanding of power dynamics often target multiple stakeholders, including legislative, administrative, judicial, electoral, cultural, and economic actors. The choice of targets depends on the specific policy goals and the power dynamics at play. For example, targeting legislators may be effective for policy change, while targeting cultural influencers may be more relevant for narrative shifts.

Advocacy strategies that prioritize building power may focus on engaging targets that have the authority to make decisions and influence policy outcomes. These strategies often involve targeting decision-makers directly and building relationships with key stakeholders.

In contrast, advocacy strategies that prioritize achieving a "win" may target a broader range of actors, including policymakers, opinion leaders, and the general public. These strategies aim to mobilize support and create a favorable environment for policy change.

The Evaluation Innovation report emphasizes the importance of understanding the power dynamics within the target institutions or systems. This understanding helps advocacy organizations identify points of resistance, gain traction, and seize windows of opportunity for policy change.

## Outcomes Achieved

The outcomes achieved through advocacy efforts are a crucial measure of success. The Evaluation Innovation report examines the results of advocacy campaigns and the quality of those results in terms of advancing equity and addressing community needs.

Advocacy strategies influenced by an understanding of power dynamics can lead to various outcomes, including policy change, systems/practice change, electoral outcomes, political shifts, narrative changes, and impact on communities. The specific outcomes depend on the goals of the advocacy campaign and the strategies deployed.

Advocacy campaigns that prioritize building power may focus on long-term transformational goals. These campaigns aim to expand power and influence over time, often through a series of time-bound campaigns. The Evaluation Innovation report provides an example of voter turnout and electoral wins increasing over multiple cycles through the use of Integrated Voter Engagement (IVE) and other electoral strategies.

Advocacy campaigns that prioritize achieving a "win" may focus on specific policy changes or immediate outcomes. These campaigns aim to achieve tangible results that address the community's articulated needs. The Evaluation Innovation report highlights the importance of assessing the quality of the results achieved and the extent to which they advance equity.

## Growth of Power Over Time

The growth of power over time is a key aspect of advocacy strategies influenced by an understanding of power dynamics. The Evaluation Innovation report examines how power expands or grows as a result of advocacy campaigns.

Advocacy strategies that prioritize building power often involve a continuous and long-term approach. These strategies aim to expand the power and influence of participants within a field of action. The report emphasizes that power building does not occur in a vacuum but is influenced by the dynamic political, economic, social, and cultural environment.

The growth of power can be observed through various indicators, such as increased voter turnout, electoral wins, changes in narratives, and shifts in political dynamics. The Evaluation Innovation report provides an example of power expanding when funders give up power over priority setting and strategy direction.

Advocacy strategies that prioritize achieving a "win" may have a more immediate focus and may not necessarily lead to the growth of power over time. However, successful policy wins can create momentum and build power for future advocacy efforts.

## Conclusion

Policy advocacy strategies influenced by an understanding of power dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the outcomes of advocacy campaigns. The choice of strategies and tactics, community engagement, target selection, and the growth of power over time all contribute to the effectiveness of advocacy efforts.

Advocacy strategies that prioritize building power focus on organizing impacted communities, engaging key stakeholders, and challenging dominant frames. These strategies aim to build long-term power and influence within a defined area.

On the other hand, advocacy strategies that prioritize achieving a "win" may have a more immediate focus on specific policy changes. These strategies often involve mobilizing support and targeting a broader range of actors.

Understanding power dynamics within the policy-making process is essential for effective advocacy. It helps advocacy organizations identify the right targets, develop appropriate strategies, and navigate the complex political environment.

Overall, policy advocacy strategies influenced by an understanding of power dynamics have the potential to create meaningful change and address societal issues. By leveraging power effectively, advocacy organizations can drive policy change, advance equity, and empower impacted communities.
