# Interdisciplinary Frameworks for Analyzing the Influence of Structural Power

## Introduction

The concept of structural power refers to the ability of actors or institutions to shape the overall framework within which interactions among various actors occur. It encompasses the capacity to influence the rules, norms, and structures that govern social, political, and economic systems. Analyzing the influence of structural power requires interdisciplinary frameworks that draw on multiple disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of power dynamics and their impact on society. This report explores various interdisciplinary frameworks for analyzing the influence of structural power, drawing on the information provided.

## Frameworks for Analyzing Structural Power

### Postcolonial Perspective

One interdisciplinary framework for analyzing the influence of structural power is the postcolonial perspective. This framework examines power imbalances in global organizations, particularly in the context of IT governance. The postcolonial perspective recognizes the historical legacies of colonialism and how they continue to shape power dynamics in contemporary global systems. By analyzing IT governance from a postcolonial perspective, researchers can uncover the structural power imbalances that perpetuate inequalities and marginalization within global organizations (Source 1).

### Neorealist Power Analysis

Neorealist power analysis is another interdisciplinary framework that can be used to analyze structural power. This framework emphasizes the role of states in shaping power structures in international relations. It argues that power is primarily determined by the distribution of material capabilities among states. Neorealist power analysis focuses on the relative power of states and their ability to influence the behavior of other actors in the international system. However, this framework has been criticized for its limited understanding of power and its failure to account for non-state actors and structural factors (Source 4).

### Interdisciplinary Framework for Power in Transition

The interdisciplinary framework for power in transition offers a comprehensive approach to studying power in relation to structural change. This framework recognizes the complex and dynamic nature of power and its interplay with social, political, and economic structures. It emphasizes the need to analyze power in a holistic manner, considering both intentional and unintended effects of decisions made by various actors. The framework also highlights the importance of creativity and novel practices in driving structural change. By adopting this interdisciplinary framework, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of power dynamics and their role in shaping societal transitions (Source 13).

### Interdisciplinary Framework for Energy System Governance

The interdisciplinary framework for energy system governance provides insights into the power dynamics and institutional arrangements that shape decision-making processes in the energy sector. This framework recognizes the need to analyze power in relation to structural change and sustainability transitions. It highlights the role of regulatory arrangements, stakeholder engagement practices, and governance design in influencing power dynamics and limiting the influence of new business models or technologies. By adopting this interdisciplinary framework, researchers can contribute to the understanding of power dynamics in energy system governance and inform policy recommendations (Source 9).

### Interdisciplinary Framework for Space Governance

The interdisciplinary framework for space governance focuses on the structural power of states in shaping the overall framework of interactions in the field of space governance. This framework recognizes that power in space governance is not solely determined by technological capabilities but also by the ability to define the rules of the game. It emphasizes the importance of analyzing the capacity of states to influence global space governance and the long-term advantages of structural power. By adopting this interdisciplinary framework, researchers can assess the relative power of different states and their impact on global space governance (Source 15).

## Conclusion

Analyzing the influence of structural power requires interdisciplinary frameworks that draw on multiple disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of power dynamics and their impact on society. The postcolonial perspective, neorealist power analysis, interdisciplinary frameworks for power in transition, energy system governance, and space governance are examples of such frameworks. These frameworks offer different perspectives and methodologies for studying structural power and its implications for social, political, and economic systems. By adopting interdisciplinary approaches, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of power dynamics and contribute to the development of more inclusive and equitable systems.
