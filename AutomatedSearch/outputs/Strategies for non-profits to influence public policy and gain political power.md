# Strategies for Nonprofits to Influence Public Policy and Gain Political Power

## Introduction

Nonprofit organizations play a crucial role in advocating for social change and influencing public policy. By engaging in strategic public policy advocacy, nonprofits can amplify their impact and work towards creating a more just and equitable society. This report explores various strategies that nonprofits can employ to influence public policy and gain political power. It highlights the importance of nonprofit engagement in the policy-making process, the benefits of integrating advocacy into nonprofit work, and the need for organizational support and transparency. The report draws on insights from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of effective strategies for nonprofits to achieve their policy goals.

## The Importance of Public Policy Advocacy for Nonprofits

Nonprofits often view public policy engagement as a peripheral activity rather than a central part of their mission. However, this perspective overlooks the significant opportunity that public policy advocacy presents for nonprofits to increase their impact. According to the National Council of Nonprofits, the highest-performing nonprofits do not focus exclusively on either policy advocacy or direct service; they engage in both. By addressing the immediate needs of their beneficiaries through direct service and advocating for systemic reforms, nonprofits can create a virtuous cycle that enhances their impact.

Public policy at all levels of government has the potential to affect the work of nonprofits. Tax, regulatory, and spending policies can significantly impact nonprofit funding, resources, and the availability of programming. Approximately 32% of nonprofit funding comes from government contracts and grants, making federal policy decisions particularly influential. However, the effects of federal policies often trickle down to the state and local levels, affecting the resources and funding available to nonprofits and their beneficiaries.

Despite the importance of public policy to the nonprofit sector, there is a lack of engagement among nonprofits compared to the business and government sectors. Nonprofits have been sitting silently on the sidelines, missing out on opportunities to shape policies that align with their mission and benefit their communities. To maximize their impact, nonprofits must recognize the value of engaging in public policy advocacy and take proactive steps to implement a strategic public policy agenda.

## Strategies for Nonprofits to Implement a Strategic Public Policy Agenda

### 1. Establish a Strategy

When implementing a strategic public policy agenda, nonprofits should consider their mission, available resources, desired outcomes, stakeholders, external environment, and legal restrictions. The Alliance for Justice has identified 13 different public policy advocacy strategies utilized by nonprofits, including public education, research, civic engagement, and policy development. The most effective strategies often involve a combination of tactics that work both inside and outside the political system.

Nonprofit leaders should research policy issues that directly affect their beneficiaries or influence their organization's work. They should identify the issue they want to target, assess its alignment with their mission or vision, and define the desired outcomes. This process helps nonprofits focus their efforts and resources on areas where they can have the greatest impact.

### 2. Establish Organizational Support

Organizational support is a crucial precondition for successful public policy advocacy. Nonprofit leaders should ensure that there is widespread support and commitment to advocacy efforts among all levels of leadership, management, and the board of directors. This support creates a solid foundation for implementing a strategic public policy agenda and ensures that the organization's advocacy efforts are aligned with its mission and values.

### 3. Engage in Direct Lobbying and Grassroots Advocacy

Nonprofits can engage in direct lobbying activities to influence legislation and policy decisions. Direct lobbying involves direct communication with public officials to persuade them to pass laws that align with the nonprofit's mission and overturn laws that are harmful. Nonprofits can also engage in grassroots advocacy, which involves mobilizing the general public to influence legislation by affecting public opinion and putting pressure on policymakers.

### 4. Build Coalitions and Collaborate with Other Organizations

Building coalitions and collaborating with other organizations can significantly enhance the effectiveness of nonprofit advocacy efforts. By joining forces with like-minded organizations, nonprofits can amplify their voices, share resources, and increase their collective influence. Collaborative advocacy allows nonprofits to leverage their collective expertise, networks, and resources to advocate for policy changes that benefit their communities.

### 5. Utilize Research and Data

Nonprofits can strengthen their advocacy efforts by utilizing research and data to support their policy recommendations. Conducting research and collecting data on the issues they are advocating for helps nonprofits build evidence-based arguments and demonstrate the need for policy changes. Research and data can also help nonprofits identify the most effective strategies and interventions to address the challenges faced by their communities.

### 6. Engage in Public Education and Awareness Campaigns

Public education and awareness campaigns are effective strategies for nonprofits to influence public opinion and build support for their policy goals. By disseminating accurate information, raising awareness about social issues, and mobilizing public support, nonprofits can create a favorable environment for policy change. Public education campaigns can include media outreach, community events, social media campaigns, and educational materials to inform the public about the importance of specific policy issues.

### 7. Foster Relationships with Policymakers

Developing relationships with policymakers is essential for nonprofits to gain political power and influence policy decisions. Nonprofits should proactively engage with elected officials, government agencies, and key stakeholders to build trust, establish credibility, and ensure that their voices are heard. By cultivating relationships with policymakers, nonprofits can become trusted sources of expertise and insights, increasing their influence in the policy-making process.

### 8. Integrate Power Building into Nonprofit Work

Power building involves organizing and mobilizing communities to advocate for policy changes that address systemic issues. Nonprofits can integrate power building into their work by providing political education to their staff, board, and program participants, facilitating community leadership development, and collaborating with grassroots organizations. By empowering their communities and fostering civic engagement, nonprofits can build a strong foundation for long-term policy change.

## Conclusion

Nonprofits have a unique opportunity to influence public policy and gain political power by implementing strategic public policy agendas. By establishing a clear strategy, building organizational support, engaging in direct lobbying and grassroots advocacy, collaborating with other organizations, utilizing research and data, conducting public education campaigns, fostering relationships with policymakers, and integrating power building into their work, nonprofits can effectively advocate for policy changes that align with their mission and benefit their communities.

To maximize their impact, nonprofits must recognize the importance of public policy advocacy and overcome the perception that it is a peripheral activity. By actively engaging in the policy-making process, nonprofits can be the voice for their mission and beneficiaries, working towards enacting policies that represent their interests. Through strategic advocacy efforts, nonprofits can create a healthier policy environment that enhances the effectiveness of their programs and services, ultimately achieving greater impact.
