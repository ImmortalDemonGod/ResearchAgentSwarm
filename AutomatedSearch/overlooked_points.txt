1. Lacking details on Pybag's functionality for non-game Python applications: The text mentions that Pybag can deploy any Python application using Pygame to the web, not just games. Our notes focus exclusively on games and do not capture capabilities for broader interactive web experiences.

2. Missing discussion of monetization challenges: The text covers difficulties with traditional in-app purchases for Pybag web games. Our notes skip this potential limitation entirely.  

3. No examples demonstrating Pybag usage: While our notes give an overview, they lack specific examples showing how developers would leverage Pybag to deploy games. Adding 1-2 examples could make the concepts more tangible.

4. Limited exploration of security considerations: The text flags security as a consideration for hosting games online with Pybag. Our notes gloss over this, missing an opportunity to elaborate on specific risks and best practices.

5. Could better situate Pybag within Python gaming ecosystem: While alternatives are mentioned, we could better position Pybag relative to existing Python game engines. This would frame it within the broader ecosystem.

6. Discussion of projection for future lacks nuance: Our concluding remarks about Pybag's future potential misses some of the text's nuance about Pybag's rapid evolution.

7. No analysis of how learning curve compares for beginners: When claiming Pybag good for beginners, our notes lack analysis of how its learning curve specifically compares vs. alternatives for new developers.
