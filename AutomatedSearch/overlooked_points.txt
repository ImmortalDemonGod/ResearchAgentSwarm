1. Evaluation methods. The notes do not provide much detail on how the technical and designer evaluations were conducted. More specifics could be included on the study design, participants, tasks, and analysis methods. 

2. Prompting techniques. The notes mention using GPT-3 but do not explain the prompt engineering techniques used to control the model's outputs. Details on the prompt chains and encoding of rules could be useful.

3. Generation examples. While an example tool is discussed, the notes lack examples of the actual generated content like persona profiles, posts, and comment threads. These could make the outputs more concrete.

4. Designer insights. The designer evaluation section focuses on the high-level outcomes rather than insights from specific examples. Including more sample insights and iterations could better showcase the technique's value.

5. Limitations. The discussion of limitations is brief. More detail could be provided both on current limitations as well as risks like overreliance on simulations that require mitigation.

6. Opportunities. There is little on opportunities for future work, such as expanding modalities beyond text, integrating real user input, applying to different communities, and developing prompting techniques.

7. Ethical considerations. The ethics of generating plausible negative behaviors could be explored more deeply both in the notes and a full report.

8. Theoretical grounding. Additional background from relevant literature could better ground the technique in prototyping theory and practice.

9. Quantitative findings. The notes could include more statistics and quantitative results from the evaluations to substantiate the claims.
