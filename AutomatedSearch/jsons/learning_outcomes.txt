Lecturers should use various techniques to capture students' attention, such as storytelling, humor, examples, and questions. Lecturing can also be combined with other methods, such as demonstrations, discussions, and multimedia, to enhance learning .
- Facilitation: This is a student-centered method that involves guiding students to discover and construct their own knowledge. Facilitators act as coaches, mentors, and resources, rather than authorities or experts. Facilitation can foster critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and self-regulation among students. Facilitation can be implemented through various strategies, such as inquiry-based learning, project-based learning, case-based learning, and peer learning .
- Assessment: This is a method that involves collecting and analyzing evidence of student learning to provide feedback, improve instruction, and evaluate outcomes. Assessment can be formative or summative, depending on the purpose and timing. Assessment can also be aligned with the learning objectives, content, and activities of the course. Assessment can enhance teaching effectiveness and student learning outcomes by providing clear expectations, criteria, and feedback, as well as motivating and engaging students in the learning process .
These are some of the potential and most practicing teaching methods in higher education, based on the web search results. However, there is no one-size-fits-all method for teaching, as different disciplines, contexts, and students may require different approaches. Therefore, teachers should be flexible, reflective, and responsive to the needs and preferences of their students, as well as the goals and standards of their programs and institutions. ðŸ“š
