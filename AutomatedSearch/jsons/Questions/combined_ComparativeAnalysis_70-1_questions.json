    "How does the broad applicability of mitochondrial research across diverse organisms, including rats, mice, humans, plants, yeast, and Xenopus oocytes, contribute to our understanding of mitochondrial functions?",
    "What factors should researchers consider when selecting the appropriate extraction technique for isolating mitochondria from different tissues and cell types, such as liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and cultured cell lines?",
    "How do the challenges of preserving mitochondrial integrity and optimizing extraction conditions for specific tissues or cell types impact the overall success and reliability of mitochondrial research findings?",
    "What are the different methodologies used to isolate and analyze mitochondria from different organisms, and how do they vary in terms of RNA, protein, and functionality analysis?",
    "Imagine you are a researcher studying mitochondrial function in lung dysfunction. How would you isolate and analyze mitochondria from mice lung tissue to facilitate your studies?",
    "How does the method of isolating mitochondria from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for genome-wide RNA analysis using DNA microarrays compare to the method used to isolate mitochondria from human cells (HepG2 and HeLa) using magnetic nanoparticles bound to monoamine oxidase-A antibodies?",
    "If you were to develop a new method to isolate and assess the functionality of mitochondria from a specific tissue or organism, what factors would you consider and why?"
