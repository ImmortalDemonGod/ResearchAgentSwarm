    "Imagine a scenario where the isolation of intact mitochondria from rat heart tissue is unsuccessful. How would this impact the ability to study cellular bioenergetics and biomolecule transport?",
    "How does the process of homogenizing the suspension and incubating with trypsin inhibitor contribute to isolating intact mitochondria?",
    "How might the isolation of intact mitochondria using this protocol contribute to our understanding of mitochondrial function and its role in various studies?",
    "If you were to design an experiment using the isolated intact mitochondria, what specific research question would you investigate and why?",
    "How much mitochondrial protein can be expected from a single heart?",
    "Imagine you are preparing mitochondria for a study. How would you ensure rapid cooling and thorough washing of the removed hearts?",
    "How does the absence of chelating agents in the final preparation affect the study of divalent cation transport in mitochondria?"
