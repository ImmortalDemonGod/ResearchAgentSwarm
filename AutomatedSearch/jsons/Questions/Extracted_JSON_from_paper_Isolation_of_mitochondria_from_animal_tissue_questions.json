    "Have you ever conducted an experiment involving the isolation of mitochondria? If so, what challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?",
    "What are the recommended steps for isolating mitochondria from animal tissue?",
    "Imagine you encounter a situation where the mitochondrial pellet is difficult to resuspend. How would you disperse it thoroughly in a small volume of buffer and then dilute it?",
    "How does the use of an optimized homogenization buffer and empirical determination of the best way to homogenize the tissue contribute to the successful isolation of mitochondria?"
