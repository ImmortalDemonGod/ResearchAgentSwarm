    "What were the two methods used for protein isolation from mitochondria in the research study conducted by the University of Western Sydney?",
    "Imagine you are a researcher studying neurodegenerative disorders. How could the identification of specific proteins in the soluble and membrane mitochondrial proteomes, such as Annexin V and Voltage dependent anion channel 1, contribute to your understanding of these disorders?",
    "If you were conducting a similar research study on protein isolation from mitochondria, what additional methods or techniques would you consider using to further analyze the proteome of mitochondria?",
    "How does the AMPIB kit selectively extract mitochondrial proteins from cell lysates and what is the potential impact on low molecular weight proteins?",
    "Imagine you are a researcher working with the AMPIB kit. How would you modify the protocol to extract both mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins without losing low molecular weight proteins?",
    "How does the sucrose density gradient centrifugation method compare to the Amresco Mitochondrial Protein Isolation Protocol in terms of obtaining a full protein profile of mitochondria?",
    "What is the purpose of fractionating mitochondrial proteins using solubilisation buffer and sucrose gradient?",
    "Imagine you are a researcher working on mitochondrial proteins. How would you design an experiment to study the interaction between MTCO2 and Tomm 22?"
