How to write effective MidJourney image prompts
## Bing
Hi, this is Bing. I'm glad you asked about MidJourney, an AI tool that can generate amazing images from text prompts. 😊
There are some tips and tricks to write effective MidJourney image prompts that can help you get the results you want. Here are some of them:
- Use correct grammar and simple language. MidJourney does not understand complex sentences or filler words. It breaks down your prompts into smaller parts called tokens and then uses them to generate art. Therefore, you should write precise and concise prompts that describe what you want to see.
- Be specific and focus on what you want. MidJourney generates art by mixing and matching the images it already has in its database. Therefore, you have to be clear and detailed about the subject, modifiers, style, and medium of your desired image. Avoid describing what you don't want, as it may confuse the AI. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try using the --no parameter at the end of your prompt.
- Use image URLs to influence the style and content of your image. You can add one or more image URLs to your prompt to give MidJourney some reference images to work with. Image URLs always go at the front of your prompt, followed by any additional text and parameters. Make sure the image URLs end with an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg.
- Use parameters to change how your image generates. Parameters are special commands that can change the aspect ratio, model, upscaler, and other settings of your image. Parameters go at the end of your prompt, starting with a double dash --. For example, --width 512 --height 512 will generate a square image with 512 pixels on each side.

Common mistakes in writing MidJourney prompts and how to avoid them
## Bing
You seem to be interested in MidJourney, an AI tool that can generate amazing images from text prompts. 😊
Writing effective MidJourney prompts can be challenging, but also rewarding. Here are some common mistakes that people make when writing prompts for MidJourney, and how to avoid them:
- Writing very long prompts. Long and complex prompts can confuse the AI model and result in poor or unexpected outcomes. Try to keep your prompts short and simple, and use correct grammar and punctuation. Avoid using filler words or unnecessary details that do not contribute to the image you want.
- Not being specific enough. MidJourney generates images by mixing and matching the images it already has in its database. Therefore, you need to be clear and precise about what you want to see in your image. Use descriptive words and modifiers that capture the subject, style, and mood of your desired image. If you want to exclude something from your image, use the --no parameter at the end of your prompt.
- Using complicated or obscure language. MidJourney does not understand slang, idioms, metaphors, or academic jargon. It works best with simple and common words that have clear meanings and associations. If you use words that are too vague or unfamiliar, the AI model may not be able to interpret them correctly or find suitable images to match them.
- Not using image URLs or parameters. MidJourney allows you to use image URLs and parameters to influence the style and content of your image. Image URLs can provide reference images for the AI model to work with, and parameters can change the settings of your image, such as the aspect ratio, model, upscaler, and more. Image URLs always go at the front of your prompt, followed by any additional text and parameters. Parameters always go at the end of your prompt, starting with a double dash --. Make sure the image URLs end with an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg.
- Not checking the results or experimenting with different prompts. MidJourney is an experimental and creative tool that can produce surprising and diverse results. Sometimes, you may not get the image you want on the first try, or you may want to explore different variations of your prompt. Therefore, it is important to check the results and see if they match your expectations, and to experiment with different prompts and see how they affect the outcome. You can also use the feedback button to rate the results and help improve the AI model.

Advanced techniques in crafting MidJourney image prompts
## Bing
Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you want to learn more about MidJourney, an AI tool that can generate amazing images from text prompts. 😊
MidJourney is a powerful and creative tool that allows you to explore the possibilities of AI art generation. However, to get the best results, you need to master some advanced techniques in crafting MidJourney image prompts.
Some of the advanced techniques are:
- Using prompt weights to control the influence of different elements in your prompt. Prompt weights are numbers that you can add after a double colon (::) to any part of your prompt. They tell the AI how much emphasis to give to that part. For example, a realistic photo, human colony on alien world, lush vegetation::2 sunny will generate an image with more lush vegetation than the default weight of 1.
- Using image URLs to provide reference images for the AI to work with. Image URLs are links to images that you can add at the beginning of your prompt, followed by any additional text and parameters. They can help the AI to match the style and content of your desired image. For example, https://i.imgur.com/9UZaY0p.jpg a realistic portrait of a woman with long curly hair and green eyes, wearing a red dress and a pearl necklace will generate an image similar to the reference image.
- Using parameters to change the settings of your image, such as the aspect ratio, model, upscaler, and more. Parameters are commands that you can add at the end of your prompt, starting with a double dash (--). They can help you to customize your image according to your preferences. For example, --width 512 --height 512 will generate a square image with 512 pixels on each side.

MidJourney prompt writing: Dos and Don'ts
## Bing
Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you want to learn about MidJourney prompt writing: Dos and Don'ts. MidJourney is an AI tool that can generate amazing images from text prompts. 😊
MidJourney prompts are command phrases that tell the AI what kind of image you want to create. They consist of four parts:
- The command /imagine, which starts every prompt.
- One or more image URLs, which provide reference images for the AI to work with. Image URLs always go at the front of the prompt, followed by any additional text and parameters. Make sure the image URLs end with an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg.
- A text prompt, which describes the subject, style, and mood of your desired image. Use correct grammar and simple language, and be specific and clear about what you want to see. Avoid describing what you don't want, as it may confuse the AI. If you want to exclude something from your image, use the --no parameter at the end of your prompt.
- Parameters, which are special commands that can change the settings of your image, such as the aspect ratio, model, upscaler, and more. Parameters always go at the end of your prompt, starting with a double dash --. For example, --width 512 --height 512 will generate a square image with 512 pixels on each side.
Here are some dos and don'ts for writing MidJourney prompts:
Do:
- Use correct grammar and simple language. MidJourney does not understand complex sentences or filler words. It breaks down your prompts into smaller parts called tokens and then uses them to generate art. Therefore, you should write precise and concise prompts that describe what you want to see.
- Be specific and focus on what you want. MidJourney generates art by mixing and matching the images it already has in its database. Therefore, you have to be clear and detailed about the subject, modifiers, style, and medium of your desired image. Avoid describing what you don't want, as it may confuse the AI. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try using the --no parameter at the end of your prompt.
- Use image URLs to influence the style and content of your image. You can add one or more image URLs to your prompt to give MidJourney some reference images to work with. Image URLs always go at the front of your prompt, followed by any additional text and parameters. Make sure the image URLs end with an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg.
- Use parameters to change how your image generates. Parameters are special commands that can change the aspect ratio, model, upscaler, and other settings of your image. Parameters go at the end of your prompt, starting with a double dash --. For example, --width 512 --height 512 will generate a square image with 512 pixels on each side.
- Experiment with different prompts and see how they affect the outcome. You can also use the feedback button to rate the results and help improve the AI model.
Don't:
- Write very long prompts. Long and complex prompts can confuse the AI model and result in poor or unexpected outcomes. Try to keep your prompts short and simple, and use correct grammar and punctuation. Avoid using filler words or unnecessary details that do not contribute to the image you want.
- Use complicated or obscure language. MidJourney does not understand slang, idioms, metaphors, or academic jargon. It works best with simple and common words that have clear meanings and associations. If you use words that are too vague or unfamiliar, the AI model may not be able to interpret them correctly or find suitable images to match them.
- Use multiple commands in one prompt. MidJourney only recognizes one command per prompt, which is /imagine. If you use other commands, such as /write or /draw, the AI model will ignore them and treat them as part of the text prompt. If you want to use different commands, you have to send separate messages for each one.
- Expect the AI to read your mind. MidJourney is an experimental and creative tool that can produce surprising and diverse results. Sometimes, you may not get the image you want on the first try, or you may want to explore different variations of your prompt. Therefore, it is important to check the results and see if they match your expectations, and to experiment with different prompts and see how they affect the outcome.
- Use MidJourney for illegal or harmful purposes. MidJourney is a tool for artistic and educational purposes only. You should not use it to create images that violate the law, infringe on someone's rights, or cause harm to anyone. You are responsible for the images you create and share with MidJourney.

Guidelines for writing MidJourney image generation prompts
Guidelines for Writing MidJourney Image Generation Prompts

1. Be Specific and Concise:

    Instead of saying "a beautiful landscape," try "a panoramic view of a lush green valley with snow-capped mountains in the background, bathed in golden sunlight."
    The more specific you are, the more accurately MidJourney can interpret your vision and generate the desired image.

2. Use Descriptive Language:

    Employ vivid adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture in your prompt. Go beyond "a tree" and say "a towering ancient oak tree with gnarled branches and vibrant green leaves."
    Descriptive language helps MidJourney create images rich in detail and evoking the emotions you desire.

3. Avoid Ambiguity:

    Use precise terms and avoid vague language subject to multiple interpretations. Instead of "a creature," describe "a majestic griffin with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion."
    This ensures MidJourney generates an image that aligns with your exact vision.

4. Designate Art Styles:

    Specify your desired artistic style, be it photorealistic, cartoony, Renaissance painting, or anything in between. Use phrases like "--style art nouveau" or "--style surrealism."
    This allows MidJourney to tailor the image to the specific artistic style you have in mind.

5. Leverage Reference Images:

    Upload relevant reference images alongside your text prompt for visual guidance and inspiration. This is especially helpful for complex scenes or specific objects.
    Reference images provide MidJourney with a clear visual target to work towards.

6. Unleash Creativity with "--creative" Tag:

    Add "--creative" to your prompt to encourage MidJourney to be more experimental and generate unexpected results.
    This can lead to surprisingly innovative and unique artwork you might not have imagined.

7. Fine-tune with Parameters:

    Utilize available parameters like aspect ratio ("--ar"), number of variations ("--v"), and seed value ("--seed") to refine your image generation.
    These parameters provide you with control over specific aspects of the image, allowing for further customization.

8. Start Simple and Build:

    Begin with basic details in your prompt and gradually add specifics as needed. This helps avoid overwhelming the AI and allows for easier refinement.

9. Embrace Active Voice:

    Write your prompts in active voice for clarity and stronger impact. Instead of "The tree is old," say "The ancient oak stands tall."

10. Compose the Scene:

    Consider the overall composition of your image, including foreground, middle ground, and background elements. Use words like "towering over" or "in the distance" to create depth and perspective.

11. Set the Mood:

Here is an addition to our notes on setting the mood and atmosphere in MidJourney prompts:

Setting the Mood and Atmosphere

The text highlights the importance of describing the desired mood and atmosphere of your image when writing MidJourney prompts. Carefully choose words and phrases that will evoke the specific feeling or tone you want to achieve. 

For example, instead of simply saying "a forest", you could say "a dark and mysterious forest with towering trees casting long shadows, a mist clinging to the ground, and an eerie silence hanging in the air". This prompt establishes an ominous and foreboding mood.

On the other hand, describing "a lush green valley with wildflowers in bloom, bathed in warm golden sunlight" creates a much more cheerful, vibrant atmosphere. 

Consider the following when setting the mood and atmosphere:

- Lighting - Is it bright or shadowy? Warm or cool toned? 

- Weather - Clear skies or stormy? Misty?

- Descriptors - What adjectives capture the feeling? Serene? Ominous? Inviting?

- Sensory details - Sights, sounds, smells that set the tone

- Perspective - Shooting angle that sets mood

Take the time to deliberately craft the atmosphere you want to achieve. This attention and care with your descriptive language will pay off with more emotionally impactful and evocative AI-generated art.

Here is an addition to our notes on composition and perspective techniques for MidJourney prompting:

Compositional Techniques

When constructing your MidJourney prompts, consider the overall composition and perspective of the scene you want to depict. Use descriptive language to establish foreground, middle ground, and background elements to create a sense of depth.

Foreground elements are closest to the viewer. Describe salient features you want to emphasize in the front of your image. This establishes a central focal point.

The middle ground adds context, scope, and scale. Place secondary subjects and supportive scenery in the mid-section of your imagined scene. 

The background receding into the distance creates perspective. Use words like "far-off", "distant", "on the horizon" to situate these tertiary elements that support the mood and reinforce linear perspective.

Other compositional techniques include:

- Framing - Use natural frames like archways, overhanging branches etc to spotlight the main subject

- Rule of thirds - Mentally divide scene into grid and place subjects along gridlines or intersections 

- Leading lines - Include converging lines to draw viewer into image through perspective

- Depth of field - Use sharpness/blurriness to establish focal hierarchy  

Consider shooting angle, lighting, positioning and other aesthetic choices that contribute to the overall balance and flow of your AI-generated image. Mastering compositional techniques takes your MidJourney images to the next level.

Here is an addition to our notes on embracing creativity and experimentation with MidJourney:

Embracing Creativity and Experimentation

The text highlights using the "--creative" parameter when writing MidJourney prompts to encourage the AI to unleash its creativity and generate more unexpected, innovative results. 

Don't be afraid to push the boundaries of your imagination and let your spontaneity run wild. The "--creative" tag tells MidJourney to fuse concepts and styles in new ways that you may not have envisioned yourself.

For example, try combining disparate ideas like "a cyberpunk samurai riding a robotic horse through a neon-lit cityscape" or blend references from art history like "Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' set in a futuristic dystopian landscape".

In addition to using the "--creative" parameter, further spur creative potential by:

- Trying unusual word combinations and descriptive phrases

- Mixing varied artistic mediums and aesthetics 

- Using whimsical metaphors and suggestive language

- Juxtaposing contradictory concepts and themes

- Throwing surprises into your prompts  

While MidJourney's algorithms impose some consistency, embracing randomness and serendipity allows room for innovation. Don't overthink or limit your prompts. Experiment with creative abandon. The results may delight and inspire you.

Here is an addition to our notes on the iterative process of refining MidJourney prompts:

The Iterative Process 

Mastering MidJourney prompt writing takes an iterative approach. Set expectations that it is rare to achieve your desired outcome perfectly on the first try. 

Instead, embrace the process of continuous experimentation, analysis, and refinement. Write your initial prompt, review the results, identify areas for improvement, then refine and rewrite for another generation.

Analyze each image against your original creative vision:

- Does the style match expectations?

- Is the composition balanced and compelling? 

- Does the mood resonate emotionally?

- What elements need changing or adding?

Use your critical analysis to rewrite and enhance your prompt. Adjust descriptors, vary style parameters, add conditional elements, or reference new images as inspiration to spur creativity. 

Leverage MidJourney features like variations (“--v”) and seed values (“--seed”) to further explore alternative interpretations with each iteration.

Through this repetitive cycle of output evaluation and input adaptation you will gain deeper understanding of MidJourney’s creative boundaries to help hone your prompts more effectively.

Eventually results will converge towards your desired vision. Enjoy the rewarding process of iterative refinement towards AI art mastery.
