What is RPA?
## Bing
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a form of business process automation that uses software robots or artificial intelligence (AI) agents. It's also known as software robotics. RPA uses automation technologies to mimic back-office tasks of human workers, such as extracting data, filling in forms, moving files, and so on. It combines APIs and user interface interactions to integrate and perform repetitive tasks across unrelated software systems.
RPA is process-driven, whereas AI is data-driven. RPA bots can only follow the processes defined by an end user, while AI bots use machine learning to recognize patterns in data, particularly unstructured data, and learn over time. However, RPA and AI complement each other well. AI can help RPA automate tasks more fully and handle more complex use cases.
RPA is transformative because it allows software robots to do repetitive and lower-value work, like logging into applications and systems, moving files and folders, extracting, copying, and inserting data, filling in forms, and completing routine analyses and reports. Advanced robots can even perform cognitive processes, like interpreting text, engaging in chats and conversations, understanding unstructured data, and applying advanced machine learning models to make complex decisions.
By deploying scripts which emulate human processes, RPA tools complete autonomous execution of various activities and transactions across unrelated software systems. This form of automation uses rule-based software to perform business process activities at a high-volume, freeing up human resources to prioritize more complex tasks. RPA enables CIOs and other decision makers to accelerate their digital transformation efforts and generate a higher return on investment (ROI) from their staff.
