Xi\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) in many real-world tasks Given the expanding tasks that could\nbenefit from LLMs and the growing task complexity, an intuitive approach to scale up the power of\nagents is to use multiple agents that cooperate Prior work suggests that multiple agents can help\nencourage divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023), improve factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023),\nand provide validation (Wu et al., 2023) In light of the intuition and early evidence of promise, it is\nintriguing to ask the following question: how can we facilitate the development of LLM applications\nthat could span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on the multi-agent approach Our insight is to use multi-agent conversations to achieve it There are at least three reasons con-\nfirming its general feasibility and utility thanks to recent advances in LLMs: First, because chat-\noptimized LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show the ability to incorporate feedback, LLM agents can cooperate\nthrough conversations with each other or human(s), e.g., a dialog where agents provide and seek rea-\nsoning, observations, critiques, and validation Second, because a single LLM can exhibit a broad\nrange of capabilities (especially when configured with the correct prompt and inference settings),\nconversations between differently configured agents can help combine these broad LLM capabilities\nin a modular and complementary manner Third, LLMs have demonstrated ability to solve complex\ntasks when the tasks are broken into simpler subtasks Multi-agent conversations can enable this\npartitioning and integration in an intuitive manner How can we leverage the above insights and\nsupport different applications with the common requirement of coordinating multiple agents, poten-\ntially backed by LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities We desire a multi-agent\nconversation framework with generic abstraction and effective implementation that has the flexibil-\nity to satisfy different application needs Achieving this requires addressing two critical questions:\n(1) How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in\nmulti-agent collaboration (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can\naccommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns In practice, applications of varying\ncomplexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different\nconversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and\nstatic vs dynamic conversation Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent\ninteractions in natural language or code Failing to adequately address these two questions would\nlimit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality While there is contemporaneous exploration of multi-agent approaches,3we present AutoGen , a\ngeneralized multi-agent conversation framework (Figure 1), based on the following new concepts 1Customizable and conversable agents AutoGen uses a generic design of agents that can lever-\nage LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them",
        "summary": "AutoGen2, an open-source framework developed by Microsoft Research in collaboration with Pennsylvania State University, University of Washington, and Xidian University, enables the creation of Next-Gen LLM applications through multi-agent conversations. The framework supports agent customization, flexible conversation patterns, and the collaboration of LLMs, humans, and tools. AutoGen2 enables the partitioning and integration of complex tasks and has been proven effective in various domains such as mathematics, coding, question answering, and online decision-making. It leverages GPT-4, a chat-optimized LLM, for incorporating feedback and facilitating conversations between agents and humans. The framework allows for the execution of code, supports natural language and code programming, and offers a generic abstraction for building reusable agents. Empirical studies validate the capabilities and effectiveness of AutoGen2 in diverse applications.",

(2) programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation-\ncentric computation andcontrol  Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and pro-\ngramming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent\nbehaviors AutoGen provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and\nexperimentation for both steps (Section 2.2)\n3We refer to Appendix A for a detailed discussion 2AutoGen also provides a collection of multi-agent applications created using conversable agents\nand conversation programming These applications demonstrate how AutoGen can easily support\napplications of various complexities and LLMs of various capabilities Moreover, we perform both\nevaluation on benchmarks and a pilot study of new applications The results show that AutoGen can\nhelp achieve outstanding performance on many tasks, and enable innovative ways of using LLMs,\nwhile reducing development effort (Section 3 and Appendix D)\n2 The AutoGen Framework\nTo reduce the effort required for developers to create complex LLM applications across various do-\nmains, a core design principle of AutoGen is to streamline and consolidate multi-agent workflows\nusing multi-agent conversations This approach also aims to maximize the reusability of imple-\nmented agents This section introduces the two key concepts of AutoGen : conversable agents and\nconversation programming 2.1 Conversable Agents\nInAutoGen , aconversable agent is an entity with a specific role that can pass messages to send and\nreceive information to and from other conversable agents, e.g., to start or continue a conversation It\nmaintains its internal context based on sent and received messages and can be configured to possess\na set of capabilities, e.g., enabled by LLMs, tools, or human input, etc The agents can act according\nto programmed behavior patterns described next Agent capabilities powered by LLMs, humans, and tools Since an agent’s capabilities directly\ninfluence how it processes and responds to messages, AutoGen allows flexibility to endow its agents\nwith various capabilities AutoGen supports many common composable capabilities for agents,\nincluding 1) LLMs LLM-backed agents exploit many capabilities of advanced LLMs such as role\nplaying, implicit state inference and progress making conditioned on conversation history, providing\nfeedback, adapting from feedback, and coding These capabilities can be combined in different ways\nvia novel prompting techniques4to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy AutoGen also offers\nenhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc.,\nvia an enhanced LLM inference layer 2) Humans Human involvement is desired or even essential\nin many LLM applications AutoGen lets a human participate in agent conversation via human-\nbacked agents, which could solicit human inputs at certain rounds of a conversation depending on\nthe agent configuration The default user proxy agent allows configurable human involvement levels\nand patterns, e.g., frequency and conditions for requesting human input including the option for\nhumans to skip providing input 3) Tools Tool-backed agents have the capability to execute tools\nvia code execution or function execution For example, the default user proxy agent in AutoGen is\nable to execute code suggested by LLMs, or make LLM-suggested function calls Agent customization and cooperation Based on application-specific needs, each agent can be\nconfigured to have a mix of basic back-end types to display complex behavior in multi-agent con-\nversations AutoGen allows easy creation of agents with specialized capabilities and roles by reusing\nor extending the built-in agents The yellow-shaded area of Figure 2 provides a sketch of the built-in\nagents in AutoGen  The ConversableAgent class is the highest-level agent abstraction and, by\ndefault, can use LLMs, humans, and tools",
        "summary": "Developers can create agents with different roles by selecting and configuring built-in capabilities. These agents can engage in multi-agent conversations, hold multiple turns of conversations autonomously, and solicit human inputs when needed. AutoGen simplifies the development of complex applications through conversation programming, which involves defining conversable agents and programming their interaction behavior. AutoGen provides ready-to-use implementations and supports a wide range of conversation patterns and agent behaviors. It also offers a collection of multi-agent applications and achieves outstanding performance while reducing development effort. AutoGen's core design principle is to streamline and consolidate multi-agent workflows using conversations, maximizing the reusability of implemented agents. Conversable agents are entities with specific roles that can pass messages and possess various capabilities enabled by LLMs, humans, and tools. AutoGen allows flexibility in endowing agents with different capabilities and supports LLMs, human-backed agents, and tool-backed agents. Agents can be customized and configured to display complex behavior in multi-agent conversations.",

assistant agent and a tool- and\nhuman-backed user proxy agent are deployed together to tackle a task Here, the assistant agent\ngenerates a solution with the help of LLMs and passes the solution to

illustrates the built-in agents provided by AutoGen , which have unified conversation interfaces\nand can be customized The middle sub-figure shows an example of using AutoGen to develop\na two-agent system with a custom reply function The bottom sub-figure illustrates the resulting\nautomated agent chat from the two-agent system during program execution By allowing custom agents that can converse with each other, conversable agents in AutoGen serve\nas a useful building block However, to develop applications where agents make meaningful progress\non tasks, developers also need to be able to specify and mold these multi-agent conversations 2.2 Conversation Programming\nAs a solution to the above problem, AutoGen utilizes conversation programming , a paradigm that\nconsiders two concepts: the first is computation – the actions agents take to compute their response\nin a multi-agent conversation And the second is control flow – the sequence (or conditions) un-\nder which these computations happen As we will show in the applications section, the ability to\nprogram these helps implement many flexible multi-agent conversation patterns In AutoGen , these\ncomputations are conversation-centric An agent takes actions relevant to the conversations it is\ninvolved in and its actions result in message passing for consequent conversations (unless a termina-\ntion condition is satisfied) Similarly, control flow is conversation-driven – the participating agents’\ndecisions on which agents to send messages to and the procedure of computation are functions of the\ninter-agent conversation This paradigm helps one to reason intuitively about a complex workflow\nas agent action taking and conversation message-passing between agents Figure 2 provides a simple illustration The bottom sub-figure shows how individual agents perform\ntheir role-specific, conversation-centric computations to generate responses (e.g., via LLM inference\ncalls and code execution) The task progresses through conversations displayed in the dialog box The middle sub-figure demonstrates a conversation-based control flow When the assistant receives\na message, the user proxy agent typically sends the human input as a reply If there is no input, it\nexecutes any code in the assistant’s message instead 4AutoGen features the following design patterns to facilitate conversation programming:\n1.Unified interfaces and auto-reply mechanisms for automated agent chat Agents in\nAutoGen have unified conversation interfaces for performing the corresponding conversation-\ncentric computation, including a send/receive function for sending/receiving messages and a\ngenerate reply function for taking actions and generating a response based on the received\nmessage AutoGen also introduces and by default adopts an agent auto-reply mechanism to\nrealize conversation-driven control: Once an agent receives a message from another agent, it au-\ntomatically invokes generate reply and sends the reply back to the sender unless a termination\ncondition is satisfied AutoGen provides built-in reply functions based on LLM inference, code\nor function execution, or human input One can also register custom reply functions to customize\nthe behavior pattern of an agent, e.g., chatting with another agent before replying to the sender\nagent Under this mechanism, once the reply functions are registered, and the conversation is\ninitialized, the conversation flow is naturally induced, and thus the agent conversation proceeds\nnaturally without any extra control plane, i.e., a special module that controls the conversation\nflow",
        "summary": "Summary (Iteration 3): The AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent are pre-configured subclasses of ConversableAgent that handle multi-agent conversations. The AssistantAgent acts as an AI assistant backed by LLMs, while the UserProxyAgent acts as a human proxy backed by humans and/or tools. In a typical scenario, they work together to solve a task. The AssistantAgent generates a solution using LLMs and passes it to the UserProxyAgent. The UserProxyAgent then solicits human input or executes the assistant's code and provides feedback to the AssistantAgent. AutoGen allows the AssistantAgent to converse with other agents in multi-step problem solving. AutoGen also supports conversation programming, which involves message passing and auto-reply mechanisms. Conversations in a group chat follow specific patterns, such as sending and receiving messages. To analyze stock price change, the AssistantAgent can plot a chart. Program execution and conversation programming are interconnected, with computation and control flow being conversation-centric. AutoGen provides unified interfaces for conversation-centric computation, including generating replies based on conversation progress and behavior patterns. The conversation flow is managed by conversation message-passing and auto-reply mechanisms, ensuring a natural conversation flow. The UserProxyAgent, as a tool- and human-backed agent, can initiate and control conversations. Customization of LLM-backed assistant agents enables conversation-driven control flow. AutoGen features design patterns that ensure a natural conversation flow in control planes, with prompts techniques for initiating conversations. AutoGenAgents Developer Code provides examples and guidance for agent conversation. Appendix C contains additional information and resources. The ChatManager handles group chats and custom agents, enabling LLM inference and code execution. It supports function execution and custom reply functions. Usage mode and prompt techniques are available for initiating conversations. The program facilitates code and function execution, as well as sending/receiving messages and generating replies. Agent customization is possible, and the default LLM-backed assistant agent can be used. The conversation-based control flow allows for generating responses and conversation-centric computations. The agent also has an auto-reply mechanism using custom reply functions. The system includes special modules depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Human proxy and prompting techniques are utilized in multi-agent conversations. Conversation programming involves control flow and conversation-centric computation. The conversation-driven control flow is supported by auto-reply mechanisms and termination conditions in the control plane.",

or transition from nat-\nural language to code control via LLM-proposed function calls (Eleti et al., 2023) In the conversation programming paradigm, one can realize multi-agent conversations of diverse\npatterns In addition to static conversation with predefined flow, AutoGen also supports dynamic\nconversation flows with multiple agents AutoGen provides two general ways to achieve this: 1)\nCustomized generate reply function: within the customized generate reply function, one\nagent can hold the current conversation while invoking conversations with other agents depending\non the content of the current message and context 2) Function calls: In this approach, LLM decides\nwhether or not to call a particular function depending on the conversation status By messaging\nadditional agents in the called functions, the LLM can drive dynamic multi-agent conversation In\naddition, AutoGen supports more complex dynamic group chat via built-in GroupChatManager ,\nwhich can dynamically select the next speaker and then broadcast its response to other agents We\nelaborate on this feature and its application in Section 3 We provide implemented working systems\nto showcase all these different patterns, with some of them visualized in Figure 3 3 Applications of AutoGen\nWe demonstrate six applications using AutoGen (see Figure 3) to illustrate its potential in simplify-\ning the development of high-performance multi-agent applications These applications are selected\nbased on their real-world relevance (A1, A2, A4, A5, A6), problem difficulty and solving capabil-\nities enabled by AutoGen (A1, A2, A3, A4), and innovative potential (A5, A6) Together, these\ncriteria showcase AutoGen ’s role in advancing the LLM-application landscape 5A1 Math Problem Solving\nA4 Multi-agent CodingCommander\nSafeguard\nWriter\nA6 Conversational ChessA2 Retrieval-augmented ChatRetrieval-augmentedAssistantRetrieval-augmentedUser Proxy\nChess Board\nHuman/AI Chess Player A\nHuman/AI Chess Player B\nStudent\nAssistant\nAssistantExpert\nAsk  expert\nBroadcast\nManager\nSpeak\nA5 Dynamic Group Chat\nALFWorldExecutorAssistant\nGrounding Agent\nA3 ALF ChatFigure 3: Six examples of diverse applications built using AutoGen  Their conversation patterns\nshow AutoGen ’s flexibility and power A1: Math Problem Solving\nMathematics is a foundational discipline and the promise of leveraging LLMs to assist with math\nproblem solving opens up a new plethora of applications and avenues for exploration, including per-\nsonalized AI tutoring, AI research assistance, etc This section demonstrates how AutoGen can help\ndevelop LLM applications for math problem solving, showcasing strong performance and flexibility\nin supporting various problem-solving paradigms (Scenario 1 ) We are able to build a system for autonomous math problem solving by directly reusing\ntwo built-in agents from AutoGen  We evaluate our system and several alternative approaches,\nincluding open-source methods such as Multi-Agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023), LangChain Re-\nAct (LangChain, 2023), vanilla GPT-4, and commercial products ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and\nChatGPT + Plugin (Wolfram Alpha), on the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset and summarize\nthe results in Figure 4a We perform evaluations over 120 randomly selected level-5 problems and\non the entire5test dataset from MATH The results show that the built-in agents from AutoGen al-\nready yield better performance out of the box compared to the alternative approaches, even including\nthe commercial ones",

AutoGen enables control through fusion of programming and natural language, allowing for various control flow management patterns. Natural language control prompts LLM-backed agents, while programming language control uses Python code. AutoGen also supports flexible transitions between natural and programming language control. It facilitates multi-agent conversations with dynamic flows and provides features like customized reply functions and function calls. AutoGen has been applied to six real-world applications, showcasing its potential in simplifying the development of high-performance multi-agent systems. One of these applications is math problem solving, where AutoGen outperforms alternative approaches, including Multi-Agent Debate, LangChain Re-Act, GPT-4, ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and ChatGPT + Plugin, on the MATH dataset. AutoGen's built-in agents, such as AssistantAgent and GroupChatManager, contribute to its strong performance and flexibility in problem-solving paradigms.",

UPDATE CONTEXT ” which will invoke more\nretrieval attempts We conduct an ablation study in which we prompt the assistant agent to say “I\ndon’t know” instead of “UPDATE CONTEXT ” in cases where relevant information is not found,\nand report results in Figure 4b The results show that the interactive retrieval mechanism indeed\nplays a non-trivial role in the process We give a concrete example and results using this appealing\nfeature in Appendix D ( Scenario 2 ) We further demonstrate how Retrieval-augmented Chat aids in\ngenerating code based on a given codebase that contains code not included in GPT-4’s training data Evaluation and demonstration details for both scenarios are included in Appendix D 6The results of DPR with GPT-3.5 shown in Figure 4b are from (Adlakha et al., 2023) We use GPT-3.5 as\na shorthand for GPT-3.5-turbo 7A3: Decision Making in Text World Environments\nIn this subsection, we demonstrate how AutoGen can be used to develop effective applications that\ninvolve interactive or online decision making We perform the study using the ALFWorld (Shridhar\net al., 2021) benchmark, which includes a diverse collection of synthetic language-based interactive\ndecision-making tasks in household environments With AutoGen , we implemented a two-agent system to solve tasks from ALFWorld It consists of\nan LLM-backed assistant agent responsible for suggesting plans to conduct a task and an executor\nagent responsible for executing actions in the ALFWorld environments",

        "summary": "This system integrates Re-Act prompting and effectively addresses the occasional inability to leverage common sense knowledge. By introducing a grounding agent, the system gains crucial context and mitigates errors, resulting in a 15% performance gain. AutoGen is used to build a multi-agent coding system, reducing code length and improving productivity. AutoGen also supports dynamic group chat, enabling flexible collaboration among agents.",

if a move\nis invalid, the agent responds with an error, prompting the player agent to re-propose a legal move\nbefore continuing This process ensures that only valid moves are played and helps maintain a con-\nsistent gaming experience As an ablation study, we removed the board agent and instead only relied\non a relevant prompt “you should make sure both you and the opponent are making legal moves” to\nground their move The results highlighted that without the board agent, illegitimate moves caused\ngame disruptions The modular design offered flexibility, allowing swift adjustments to the board\nagent in response to evolving game rules or varying chess rule variants A comprehensive demon-\nstration of this ablation study is in Appendix D 4 Discussion\nWe introduced an open-source library, AutoGen , that incorporates the paradigms of conversable\nagents and conversation programming This library utilizes capable agents that are well-suited for\nmulti-agent cooperation It features a unified conversation interface among the agents, along with\nan auto-reply mechanisms, which help establish an agent-interaction interface that capitalizes on the\nstrengths of chat-optimized LLMs with broad capabilities while accommodating a wide range of\napplications AutoGen serves as a general framework for creating and experimenting with multi-\nagent systems that can easily fulfill various practical requirements, such as reusing, customizing,\nand extending existing agents, as well as programming conversations between them Our experiments, as detailed in Section 3, demonstrate that this approach offers numerous benefits The adoption of AutoGen has resulted in improved performance (over state-of-the-art approaches),\nreduced development code, and decreased manual burden for existing applications It offers flex-\nibility to developers, as demonstrated in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, where AutoGen enables\nmulti-agent chats to follow a dynamic pattern rather than fixed back-and-forth interactions It allows\nhumans to engage in activities alongside multiple AI agents in a conversational manner Despite the\ncomplexity of these applications (most involving more than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent\ncooperation), the implementation based on AutoGen remains straightforward Dividing tasks among\nseparate agents promotes modularity Furthermore, since each agent can be developed, tested, and\nmaintained separately, this approach simplifies overall development and code management 9Although this work is still in its early experimental stages, it paves the way for numerous future\ndirections and research opportunities For instance, we can explore effective integration of existing\nagent implementations into our multi-agent framework and investigate the optimal balance between\nautomation and human control in multi-agent workflows As we further develop and refine AutoGen ,\nwe aim to investigate which strategies, such as agent topology and conversation patterns, lead to the\nmost effective multi-agent conversations while optimizing the overall efficiency, among other fac-\ntors While increasing the number of agents and other degrees of freedom presents opportunities for\ntackling more complex problems, it may also introduce new safety challenges that require additional\nstudies and careful consideration We provide more discussion in Appendix B, including guidelines for using AutoGen and direction\nof future work We hope AutoGen will help improve many LLM applications in terms of speed of\ndevelopment, ease of experimentation, and overall effectiveness and safety We actively welcome\ncontributions from the broader community Ethics statement\nThere are several potential ethical considerations that could arise from the development and use of\ntheAutoGen framework • Privacy and Data Protection: The framework allows for human participation in conversations\nbetween agents It is important to ensure that user data and conversations are protected, and that\ndevelopers use appropriate measures to safeguard privacy",
        "summary": "Utilizing role-play prompts in complex tasks leads to more effective consideration of conversation context and role alignment, resulting in higher success rates and fewer LLM calls. The Conversational Chess game, developed using AutoGen, features built-in agents for players and a board agent to validate moves. AutoGen enables natural and engaging game dynamics and maintains game integrity through move grounding. The modular design of AutoGen allows for flexibility and easy adjustments. AutoGen serves as a general framework for creating multi-agent systems with various practical requirements. It improves performance, reduces development code, and decreases manual burden. The framework paves the way for future research opportunities, including effective integration of existing agent implementations and optimization of multi-agent conversations. Privacy and data protection are important considerations when using the AutoGen framework.",

crucial to address and mitigate\nany biases that may arise in the conversations between agents Developers should be aware of\npotential biases and take steps to ensure fairness and inclusivity • Accountability and Transparency: As discussed in the future work section, as the framework in-\nvolves multiple agents conversing and cooperating, it is important to establish clear accountability\nand transparency mechanisms Users should be able to understand and trace the decision-making\nprocess of the agents involved in order to ensure accountability and address any potential issues\nor biases • Trust and Reliance: AutoGen leverages human understanding and intelligence while providing\nautomation through conversations between agents It is important to consider the impact of this\ninteraction on user experience, trust, and reliance on AI systems Clear communication and user\neducation about the capabilities and limitations of the system will be essential (Cai et al., 2019) • Unintended Consequences: As discussed before, the use of multi-agent conversations and automa-\ntion in complex tasks may have unintended consequences In particular, allowing LLM agents to\nmake changes in external environments through code execution or function calls, such as installing\npackages, could be risky Developers should carefully consider the potential risks and ensure that\nappropriate safeguards are in place to prevent harm or negative outcomes Acknowledgements\nThe work presented in this report was made possible through discussions and feedback from Peter\nLee,
