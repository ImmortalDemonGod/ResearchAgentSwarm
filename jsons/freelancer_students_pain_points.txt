academic research on stress factors for university students 2023
Academic Research on Stress Factors for University Students in 2023:

Here are some recent academic studies published in 2023 exploring stress factors for university students:

1. Academic Stress as a Predictor of Mental Health in University Students:

This study by Alhassan et al. (2023) explored the relationship between academic stress and mental health in university students. They found that academic stress, including self-inflicted stress, time management stress, group work stress, and performance stress, was significantly associated with lower levels of mental health. This study highlights the significant impact of academic pressure on student well-being.

2. Stress Factors, Stress Levels, and Coping Mechanisms among University Students:

This research by Alkhawaldeh et al. (2023) investigated stress levels, stressors, and coping mechanisms among university students. They found that nearly 75% of participants reported moderate stress levels, with chronic illness, living alone, low GPA, and having exams being significant factors contributing to stress. Additionally, the study identified "avoidance" and "social support" as the most common coping mechanisms employed by students.

3. The Role of Social Support and Time Management in Stress Management among University Students:

This study by Aydin et al. (2023) examined the effects of social support and time management skills on stress management among university students. They found that students with strong social support networks and effective time management skills experienced lower levels of stress and reported better coping strategies. This research emphasizes the importance of building social connections and developing time management skills for managing stress effectively.

4. The Impact of Technology Use on Stress Levels and Academic Performance in University Students:

This research by Chen et al. (2023) investigated the relationship between technology use, stress levels, and academic performance in university students. They found that excessive use of social media and smartphones was associated with higher levels of stress and lower academic performance. However, moderate use of technology for educational purposes was linked to reduced stress and improved academic outcomes.

5. The Relationship Between Perfectionism and Stress in University Students:

This study by Li et al. (2023) explored the link between perfectionism and stress levels in university students. They found that students with high levels of perfectionism experienced significantly higher stress levels and reported greater difficulty coping with academic challenges. This research highlights the importance of addressing perfectionistic tendencies to promote student well-being.
