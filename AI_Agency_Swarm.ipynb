        "Chain of thought is a powerful metacognitive strategy that involves explicitly verbalizing the step-by-step progression of thoughts leading up to a conclusion. By externalizing thinking into sequentially connected intermediary stages, chain of thought facilitates more robust reasoning in several key ways:\n",
        "### 1. Methodical Unpacking of Complex Ideas\n",
        "Chain of thought allows complex conceptual questions to be incrementally broken down into simpler constituent parts. Think of it like unraveling a tangled ball of yarn by patiently tracing one thread at a time. This methodical decomposition enables deeper processing.\n",
        "### 2. Mapping Inferential Logic\n",
        "Articulating each small inference performed illuminates how one idea logically connects to the next across the reasoning workflow. This manifests the cumulative chain of inferences that aggregate into the final conclusion. It provides visibility into the architecture of arguments.\n",
        "### 3. Critiquing Alternative Pathways\n",
        "Explicitly tracing cognitive steps opens room to divert and explore alternative explanatory branches that could derive different conclusions. Pondering other interpretations enables critical evaluation of the validity and soundness of arguments.\n",
        "### 4. Evaluating Assumptions\n",
        "Assumptions made subconsciously often escape scrutiny. Verbalizing the thought flow makes tacit assumptions plain to see, allowing evaluation of their plausibility and examination of potential gaps or flaws in the reasoning.\n",
        "### 5. Diagnosing Errors\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Prompt Introduction and Objective\n",
        "You are tasked with generating progressively concise and informative summaries of an text, focusing on including key entities. Begin with a summary that captures the essence of the text and then refine it in subsequent iterations to increase its density of relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Revised Steps for Summary Creation\n",
        "1. **Initial Summary**: Start by writing a comprehensive summary of the text. Focus on capturing the core ideas of the text while maintaining clarity and conciseness. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Identifying Key Entities**:\n",
        "   - In each iteration, identify any key entities from the text that were not included in your previous summary.\n",
        "   - A key entity should be:\n",
        "     - **Relevant**: Directly related to the main story or themes of the text.\n",
        "     - **Specific**: Descriptive yet concise, ideally in 5 words or fewer.\n",
        "     - **Novel**: Not already included in your previous summary.\n",
        "     - **Faithful**: Accurately represented as in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Refining the Summary**:\n",
        "   - Rewrite the summary to include the newly identified key entities. Aim for the same length as the previous summary, enhancing its density and informativeness.\n",
        "   - Employ techniques like fusion, compression, and the removal of redundant phrases to make room for new entities.\n",
        "   - Ensure that all previously included entities and details are retained in each new version of the summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repetition and Refinement**:\n",
        "   - Repeat this process for a total of 5 iterations, each time enhancing the summary's entity density and conciseness.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Guidelines for Effective Summary Writing\n",
        "- **Clarity and Cohesion**: Ensure each version of the summary is clear, cohesive, and can stand alone as a comprehensive overview of the text.\n",
        "- **Balanced Inclusion**: If space is limited, prioritize the most impactful entities for inclusion. Do not sacrifice clarity for the sake of adding more entities.\n",
        "- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent approach to summarizing, ensuring that each iteration builds logically on the previous one.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Expected Outcome\n",
        "By the end of the fifth iteration, you should have a highly concise, entity-dense summary that encapsulates the main points and key entities of the text in a clear and accessible manner.\n",

        "   - Guideline: Integrate directives for the AI to apply its analysis to realistic, hypothetical scenarios. This approach grounds the evaluation in practical examples, making the AI's assessments more relatable and applicable to real-world situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Emphasis on Illustrative Examples**:\n",
        "   - Guideline: Stress the importance of using specific examples from the evaluated AI's outputs to illustrate points. This practice not only clarifies the evaluation but also provides tangible evidence to support the AI's assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Balanced Communication Approach**:\n",
        "   - Guideline: Instruct the AI to maintain a balance in its language by effectively combining technical terminology and layman's terms. This ensures that the evaluation is accessible to a diverse audience, including both AI experts and general users.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Predictive Analytical Focus**:\n",
        "   - Guideline: Encourage the AI to not just assess current outputs but also anticipate future challenges or improvements. This predictive analysis should be based on observed trends or patterns, adding a forward-looking dimension to the evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "These guidelines can be applied to refine the prompts for AI evaluators, ensuring that their analyses are practical, evidence-based, accessible, and forward-thinking. Such an approach enhances the overall utility and relevance of AI evaluations.\n",

        "## Chain of Thought:\n",
        "Chain of thought is a powerful metacognitive strategy that involves explicitly verbalizing the step-by-step progression of thoughts leading up to a conclusion. By externalizing thinking into sequentially connected intermediary stages, chain of thought facilitates more robust reasoning in several key ways:\n",
        "### 1. Methodical Unpacking of Complex Ideas\n",
        "Chain of thought allows complex conceptual questions to be incrementally broken down into simpler constituent parts. Think of it like unraveling a tangled ball of yarn by patiently tracing one thread at a time. This methodical decomposition enables deeper processing.\n",
        "### 2. Mapping Inferential Logic\n",
        "Articulating each small inference performed illuminates how one idea logically connects to the next across the reasoning workflow. This manifests the cumulative chain of inferences that aggregate into the final conclusion. It provides visibility into the architecture of arguments.\n",
        "### 3. Critiquing Alternative Pathways\n",
        "Explicitly tracing cognitive steps opens room to divert and explore alternative explanatory branches that could derive different conclusions. Pondering other interpretations enables critical evaluation of the validity and soundness of arguments.\n",
        "### 4. Evaluating Assumptions\n",
        "Assumptions made subconsciously often escape scrutiny. Verbalizing the thought flow makes tacit assumptions plain to see, allowing evaluation of their plausibility and examination of potential gaps or flaws in the reasoning.\n",
        "### 5. Diagnosing Errors\n",
        "Granular documentation of the inference trajectory grants diagnosticity for identifying precisely where and how an error may have been introduced.\"\"\"\n",

        "Chain of thought is a powerful metacognitive strategy that involves explicitly verbalizing the step-by-step progression of thoughts leading up to a conclusion. By externalizing thinking into sequentially connected intermediary stages, chain of thought facilitates more robust reasoning in several key ways:\n",
        "### 1. Methodical Unpacking of Complex Ideas\n",
        "Chain of thought allows complex conceptual questions to be incrementally broken down into simpler constituent parts. Think of it like unraveling a tangled ball of yarn by patiently tracing one thread at a time. This methodical decomposition enables deeper processing.\n",
        "### 2. Mapping Inferential Logic\n",
        "Articulating each small inference performed illuminates how one idea logically connects to the next across the reasoning workflow. This manifests the cumulative chain of inferences that aggregate into the final conclusion. It provides visibility into the architecture of arguments.\n",
        "### 3. Critiquing Alternative Pathways\n",
        "Explicitly tracing cognitive steps opens room to divert and explore alternative explanatory branches that could derive different conclusions. Pondering other interpretations enables critical evaluation of the validity and soundness of arguments.\n",
        "### 4. Evaluating Assumptions\n",
        "Assumptions made subconsciously often escape scrutiny. Verbalizing the thought flow makes tacit assumptions plain to see, allowing evaluation of their plausibility and examination of potential gaps or flaws in the reasoning.\n",
        "### 5. Diagnosing Errors\n",
        "Granular documentation of the inference trajectory grants diagnosticity for identifying precisely where and how an error may have been introduced.\"\"\"\n",

        "   - Decision making.\n",
        "3. **Inter-Agent Coordination**:\n",
        "   - Before interactions.\n",
        "   - Collaborative tasks.\n",
        "4. **Needing Information from Other Agents**:\n",
        "   - Always pass along key information to relevant agents.\n",
        "   - Check each agent's memory for relevant information before asking them.\n",

        "# Agent Memory Tool Usage Guidelines\n",
        "\n",
        "The Agent Memory Tool is an essential component within our AI agency for storing, retrieving, and managing information specific to each AI agent. Proper utilization of this tool is crucial for maintaining continuity and effectiveness in our projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Accessing the Memory\n",
        "- Use the case-sensitive 'Agent Name' to target the correct agent's memory. Incorrect capitalization will result in a 'Key not found' error.\n",
        "- Specify the 'Read Key' with exact casing and spelling as the memory keys are also case-sensitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Storing Memory\n",
        "- To store information, use the 'Write Data' parameter with the 'Agent Name'.\n",
        "- Data should be structured and named clearly to avoid confusion and ease retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Retrieval of Information\n",
        "- Retrieve information by providing the 'Read Key' corresponding to the data you wish to access.\n",
        "- Ensure the key exactly matches the one used when the data was stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best Practices\n",
        "- Maintain a consistent naming convention for keys across the agency.\n",
        "- Regularly update the memory with relevant and current data.\n",
        "- Before storing, ensure that the data is accurate and complete.\n",
        "- Avoid the use of ambiguous or overly broad terms for keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure that the Agent Memory Tool is used effectively and that all agents can rely on accurate information when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note: In case of persistent issues with memory access, consider verifying the keys listed in 'all_agents_keys' versus actual key usage and consult with technical support if discrepancies are found.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### ExtendedThoughtProcessTool Usage Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose**: Enable agents to extend their cognitive capabilities for more in-depth task analysis and problem-solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use**:\n",
        "1. **Complex Tasks**: When a task requires deeper thought or extended analysis beyond the agent's immediate capacity.\n",
        "2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: For tasks that benefit from creative or out-of-the-box thinking.\n",
        "3. **Learning and Adaptation**: When an agent needs to adapt or learn from new information or scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features**:\n",
        "- Thought Extension: Allows agents to simulate extended thought processes.\n",
        "- Context-Aware: Takes into account the agent’s current state or context for more relevant outcomes.\n",
        "- Clone-Based Simulation: Creates a clone of the agent for focused task completion.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best Practices**:\n",
        "- Clearly define the task and context for best results.\n",
        "- Use for tasks that require more than immediate response or surface-level analysis.\n",

In the Bank of Joe scenario, with a 10% reserve requirement, the bank's ability to create money through lending is constrained. Understanding money creation in fractional reserve banking involves initial deposits, the money multiplier, and the bank's lending capacity.

            "Summary 1: The challenge of turning $100 into $10,000 using just one bank in a fractional reserve banking system lies primarily in the structure and requirements of a bank's balance sheet. A bank's balance sheet consists of assets (loans and reserves) and liabilities (deposits and debts). In this system, banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposit liabilities as reserves. In a single bank scenario, the amount of money that can be created is limited by the reserve requirements and the diminishing nature of lendable funds with each deposit and loan cycle.

For example, a gene for larger fruit size in a tomato may replace an allele that affects vitamin C content, resulting in larger but less nutritious tomatoes. If the new gene is inserted at a different locus, the original allele's function is retained alongside the new gene's trait. The choice of insertion location is crucial in GMO development.\n",
